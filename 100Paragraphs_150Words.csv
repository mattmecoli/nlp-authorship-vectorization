224,betrayed no impatience shunned all offensive acts on the other hand possibly because he divined in buck a dangerous rival spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth he even went out of his way to bully buck striving constantly to start the fight which could end only in the death of one or the other early in the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted accident at the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp on the shore of lake le barge driving snow a wind that cut like a whitehot knife and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping place they could hardly have fared worse at their backs rose a perpendicular wall of rock and perrault and francois were compelled to make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake,JackLondon,male,naturalism
225,till now buck had avoided trouble with his enemy but this was too much the beast in him roared he sprang upon spitz with a fury which surprised them both and spitz particularly for his whole experience with buck had gone to teach him that his rival was an unusually timid dog who managed to hold his own only because of his great weight and size francois was surprised too when they shot out in a tangle from the disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble aaah he cried to buck gif it to heem by gar gif it to heem the dirty teef spitz was equally willing he was crying with sheer rage and eagerness as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in buck was no less eager and no less cautious as he likewise circled back and forth for the advantage but,JackLondon,male,naturalism

230,ration of fish which francois had to bring to him also the dogdriver rubbed bucks feet for half an hour each night after supper and sacrificed the tops of his own moccasins to make four moccasins for buck this was a great relief and buck caused even the weazened face of perrault to twist itself into a grin one morning when francois forgot the moccasins and buck lay on his back his four feet waving appealingly in the air and refused to budge without them later his feet grew hard to the trail and the wornout footgear was thrown away at the pelly one morning as they were harnessing up dolly who had never been conspicuous for anything went suddenly mad she announced her condition by a long heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog bristling with fear then sprang straight for buck he had never seen a dog go mad,JackLondon,male,naturalism

232,and breaks their hearts if they are cut out of the harness this was the pride of dave as wheeldog of solleks as he pulled with all his strength the pride that laid hold of them at break of camp transforming them from sour and sullen brutes into straining eager ambitious creatures the pride that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent this was the pride that bore up spitz and made him thrash the sleddogs who blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at harnessup time in the morning likewise it was this pride that made him fear buck as a possible leaddog and this was bucks pride too he openly threatened the others leadership he came between him and the shirks he should have punished and he did it deliberately one,JackLondon,male,naturalism
233,morning pike the malingerer did not appear he was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow francois called him and sought him in vain spitz was wild with wrath he raged through the camp smelling and digging in every likely place snarling so frightfully that pike heard and shivered in his hidingplace but when he was at last unearthed and spitz flew at him to punish him buck flew with equal rage in between so unexpected was it and so shrewdly managed that spitz was hurled backward and off his feet pike who had been trembling abjectly took heart at this open mutiny and sprang upon his overthrown leader buck to whom fair play was a forgotten code likewise sprang upon spitz but francois chuckling at the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice brought his lash down upon buck with all his might this failed to,JackLondon,male,naturalism
234,sounds of quarrelling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe fearful that buck and spitz were at it but the opportunity did not present itself and they pulled into dawson one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come here were many men and countless dogs and buck found them all at work it seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work all day they swung up and down the main street in long teams and in the night their jingling bells still went by they hauled cabin logs and firewood freighted up to the mines and did all manner of work that horses did in the santa clara valley here and there buck met southland dogs but in the main they were the wild wolf husky breed every night regularly at nine at twelve at three they lifted a nocturnal song,JackLondon,male,naturalism
235,the woe of unnumbered generations this plaint by which buck was so strangely stirred when he moaned and sobbed it was with the pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers and the fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery and that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling ages seven days from the time they pulled into dawson they dropped down the steep bank by the barracks to the yukon trail and pulled for dyea and salt water perrault was carrying despatches if anything more urgent than those he had brought in also the travel pride had gripped him and he purposed to make the record trip of the year several things favored him,JackLondon,male,naturalism
236,running was achieved not without great trouble and vexation on the part of francois the insidious revolt led by buck had destroyed the solidarity of the team it no longer was as one dog leaping in the traces the encouragement buck gave the rebels led them into all kinds of petty misdemeanors no more was spitz a leader greatly to be feared the old awe departed and they grew equal to challenging his authority pike robbed him of half a fish one night and gulped it down under the protection of buck another night dub and joe fought spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved and even billee the goodnatured was less goodnatured and whined not half so placatingly as in former days buck never came near spitz without snarling and bristling menacingly in fact his conduct approached that of a bully and he was given to swaggering up,JackLondon,male,naturalism

238,man may shriek at sound of this the cry of life plunging down from lifes apex in the grip of death the fall pack at bucks heels raised a hells chorus of delight buck did not cry out he did not check himself but drove in upon spitz shoulder to shoulder so hard that he missed the throat they rolled over and over in the powdery snow spitz gained his feet almost as though he had not been overthrown slashing buck down the shoulder and leaping clear twice his teeth clipped together like the steel jaws of a trap as he backed away for better footing with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled in a flash buck knew it the time had come it was to the death as they circled about snarling ears laid back keenly watchful for the advantage the scene came to buck with a sense,JackLondon,male,naturalism
239,dogs that were illtamed wolves and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle they too were silent their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward to buck it was nothing new or strange this scene of old time it was as though it had always been the wonted way of things spitz was a practised fighter from spitzbergen through the arctic and across canada and the barrens he had held his own with all manner of dogs and achieved to mastery over them bitter rage was his but never blind rage in passion to rend and destroy he never forgot that his enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy he never rushed till he was prepared to receive a rush never attacked till he had first defended that attack in vain buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog,JackLondon,male,naturalism
240,panting hard the fight was growing desperate and all the while the silent and wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down as buck grew winded spitz took to rushing and he kept him staggering for footing once buck went over and the whole circle of sixty dogs started up but he recovered himself almost in mid air and the circle sank down again and waited but buck possessed a quality that made for greatnessimagination he fought by instinct but he could fight by head as well he rushed as though attempting the old shoulder trick but at the last instant swept low to the snow and in his teeth closed on spitzs left fore leg there was a crunch of breaking bone and the white dog faced him on three legs thrice he tried to knock him over then repeated the trick and broke the right fore leg,JackLondon,male,naturalism
241,and silvery breaths drifting upward closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past only this time he was the one who was beaten there was no hope for him buck was inexorable mercy was a thing reserved for gentler climes he manoeuvred for the final rush the circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on his flanks he could see them beyond spitz and to either side half crouching for the spring their eyes fixed upon him a pause seemed to fall every animal was motionless as though turned to stone only spitz quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth snarling with horrible menace as though to frighten off impending death then buck sprang in and out but while he was in shoulder had at last squarely met shoulder the dark circle became a,JackLondon,male,naturalism

243,cursed him and his fathers and mothers before him and all his seed to come after him down to the remotest generation and every hair on his body and drop of blood in his veins and he answered curse with snarl and kept out of their reach he did not try to run away but retreated around and around the camp advertising plainly that when his desire was met he would come in and be good francois sat down and scratched his head perrault looked at his watch and swore time was flying and they should have been on the trail an hour gone francois scratched his head again he shook it and grinned sheepishly at the courier who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they were beaten then francois went up to where solleks stood and called to buck buck laughed as dogs laugh yet kept his distance francois unfastened,JackLondon,male,naturalism

245,cold the temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip the men rode and ran by turn and the dogs were kept on the jump with but infrequent stoppages the thirty mile river was comparatively coated with ice and they covered in one day going out what had taken them ten days coming in in one run they made a sixtymile dash from the foot of lake le barge to the white horse rapids across marsh tagish and bennett seventy miles of lakes they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to run towed behind the sled at the end of a rope and on the last night of the second week they topped white pass and dropped down the sea slope with the lights of skaguay and of the shipping at their feet it was a record run each day for fourteen days,JackLondon,male,naturalism
246,pole buck did not like it but he bore up well to the work taking pride in it after the manner of dave and solleks and seeing that his mates whether they prided in it or not did their fair share it was a monotonous life operating with machinelike regularity one day was very like another at a certain time each morning the cooks turned out fires were built and breakfast was eaten then while some broke camp others harnessed the dogs and they were under way an hour or so before the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn at night camp was made some pitched the flies others cut firewood and pine boughs for the beds and still others carried water or ice for the cooks also the dogs were fed to them this was the one feature of the day though it was good to loaf around after,JackLondon,male,naturalism
247,he remembered the man in the red sweater the death of curly the great fight with spitz and the good things he had eaten or would like to eat he was not homesick the sunland was very dim and distant and such memories had no power over him far more potent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never seen before a seeming familiarity the instincts which were but the memories of his ancestors become habits which had lapsed in later days and still later in him quickened and become alive again sometimes as he crouched there blinking dreamily at the flames it seemed that the flames were of another fire and that as he crouched by this other fire he saw another and different man from the halfbreed cook before him this other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm with muscles that were,JackLondon,male,naturalism

249,and to make matters worse it snowed every day this meant a soft trail greater friction on the runners and heavier pulling for the dogs yet the drivers were fair through it all and did their best for the animals each night the dogs were attended to first they ate before the drivers ate and no man sought his sleepingrobe till he had seen to the feet of the dogs he drove still their strength went down since the beginning of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles dragging sleds the whole weary distance and eighteen hundred miles will tell upon life of the toughest buck stood it keeping his mates up to their work and maintaining discipline though he too was very tired billee cried and whimpered regularly in his sleep each night joe was sourer than ever and solleks was unapproachable blind side or other side but it,JackLondon,male,naturalism

353,is impossible of right that men should do so because all men being born under government they are to submit to that and are not at liberty to begin a new one sect 101 to the first there is this to answer that it is not at all to be wondered that history gives us but a very little account of men that lived together in the state of nature the inconveniences of that condition and the love and want of society no sooner brought any number of them together but they presently united and incorporated if they designed to continue together and if we may not suppose men ever to have been in the state of nature because we hear not much of them in such a state we may as well suppose the armies of salmanasser or xerxes were never children because we hear little of them till they,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
354,amongst a people till a long continuation of civil society has by other more necessary arts provided for their safety ease and plenty and then they begin to look after the history of their founders and search into their original when they have outlived the memory of it for it is with commonwealths as with particular persons they are commonly ignorant of their own births and infancies and if they know any thing of their original they are beholden for it to the accidental records that others have kept of it and those that we have of the beginning of any polities in the world excepting that of the jews where god himself immediately interposed and which favours not at all paternal dominion are all either plain instances of such a beginning as i have mentioned or at least have manifest footsteps of it sect 102 he must shew a strange,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
355,power as they contend for sect 104 but to conclude reason being plain on our side that men are naturally free and the examples of history shewing that the governments of the world that were begun in peace had their beginning laid on that foundation and were made by the consent of the people there can be little room for doubt either where the right is or what has been the opinion or practice of mankind about the first erecting of governments sect 105 i will not deny that if we look back as far as history will direct us towards the original of commonwealths we shall generally find them under the government and administration of one man and i am also apt to believe that where a family was numerous enough to subsist by itself and continued entire together without mixing with others as it often happens where there is,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
356,families met and consented to continue together there it is not to be doubted but they used their natural freedom to set up him whom they judged the ablest and most likely to rule well over them conformable hereunto we find the people of america who living out of the reach of the conquering swords and spreading domination of the two great empires of peru and mexico enjoyed their own natural freedom though caeteris paribus they commonly prefer the heir of their deceased king yet if they find him any way weak or uncapable they pass him by and set up the stoutest and bravest man for their ruler sect 106 thus though looking back as far as records give us any account of peopling the world and the history of nations we commonly find the government to be in one hand yet it destroys not that which i affirm viz,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
357,that they should pitch upon and naturally run into that form of government which from their infancy they had been all accustomed to and which by experience they had found both easy and safe to which if we add that monarchy being simple and most obvious to men whom neither experience had instructed in forms of government nor the ambition or insolence of empire had taught to beware of the encroachments of prerogative or the inconveniences of absolute power which monarchy in succession was apt to lay claim to and bring upon them it was not at all strange that they should not much trouble themselves to think of methods of restraining any exorbitances of those to whom they had given the authority over them and of balancing the power of government by placing several parts of it in different hands they had neither felt the oppression of tyrannical dominion nor,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
358,matter for covetousness or ambition give them any reason to apprehend or provide against it and therefore it is no wonder they put themselves into such a frame of government as was not only as i said most obvious and simple but also best suited to their present state and condition which stood more in need of defence against foreign invasions and injuries than of multiplicity of laws the equality of a simple poor way of living confining their desires within the narrow bounds of each mans small property made few controversies and so no need of many laws to decide them or variety of officers to superintend the process or look after the execution of justice where there were but few trespasses and few offenders since then those who like one another so well as to join into society cannot but be supposed to have some acquaintance and friendship together,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

360,kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people xiii 14 as if the whole kingly authority were nothing else but to be their general and therefore the tribes who had stuck to sauls family and opposed davids reign when they came to hebron with terms of submission to him they tell him amongst other arguments they had to submit to him as to their king that he was in effect their king in sauls time and therefore they had no reason but to receive him as their king now also say they in time past when saul was king over us thou wast he that reddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord said unto thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel sect,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

362,allowed paternal power to have a right to dominion or to be the foundation of all government and thus much may suffice to shew that as far as we have any light from history we have reason to conclude that all peaceful beginnings of government have been laid in the consent of the people i say peaceful because i shall have occasion in another place to speak of conquest which some esteem a way of beginning of governments the other objection i find urged against the beginning of polities in the way i have mentioned is this viz sect 113 that all men being born under government some or other it is impossible any of them should ever be free and at liberty to unite together and begin a new one or ever be able to erect a lawful government if this argument be good i ask how came so many,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
363,prince one lawful government in the world and then they have nothing to do but barely to shew us which that is which when they have done i doubt not but all mankind will easily agree to pay obedience to him sect 114 though it be a sufficient answer to their objection to shew that it involves them in the same difficulties that it doth those they use it against yet i shall endeavour to discover the weakness of this argument a little farther all men say they are born under government and therefore they cannot be at liberty to begin a new one every one is born a subject to his father or his prince and is therefore under the perpetual tie of subjection and allegiance it is plain mankind never owned nor considered any such natural subjection that they were born in to one or to the other that,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
364,naturally subjects to it and have no more any title or pretence to the freedom of the state of nature have no other reason bating that of paternal power which we have already answered to produce for it but only because our fathers or progenitors passed away their natural liberty and thereby bound up themselves and their posterity to a perpetual subjection to the government which they themselves submitted to it is true that whatever engagements or promises any one has made for himself he is under the obligation of them but cannot by any compact whatsoever bind his children or posterity for his son when a man being altogether as free as the father any act of the father can no more give away the liberty of the son than it can of any body else he may indeed annex such conditions to the land he enjoyed as a subject,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
365,his fathers property he may dispose or settle it as he pleases sect 117 and this has generally given the occasion to mistake in this matter because commonwealths not permitting any part of their dominions to be dismembered nor to be enjoyed by any but those of their community the son cannot ordinarily enjoy the possessions of his father but under the same terms his father did by becoming a member of the society whereby he puts himself presently under the government he finds there established as much as any other subject of that commonwealth and thus the consent of freemen born under government which only makes them members of it being given separately in their turns as each comes to be of age and not in a multitude together people take no notice of it and thinking it not done at all or not necessary conclude they are naturally subjects,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
366,it otherwise they claim no power over the son because of that they had over the father nor look on children as being their subjects by their fathers being so if a subject of england have a child by an english woman in france whose subject is he not the king of englands for he must have leave to be admitted to the privileges of it nor the king of frances for how then has his father a liberty to bring him away and breed him as he pleases and who ever was judged as a traytor or deserter if he left or warred against a country for being barely born in it of parents that were aliens there it is plain then by the practice of governments themselves as well as by the law of right reason that a child is born a subject of no country or government he,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
367,a mans consent to make him subject to the laws of any government there is a common distinction of an express and a tacit consent which will concern our present case no body doubts but an express consent of any man entering into any society makes him a perfect member of that society a subject of that government the difficulty is what ought to be looked upon as a tacit consent and how far it binds ie how far any one shall be looked on to have consented and thereby submitted to any government where he has made no expressions of it at all and to this i say that every man that hath any possessions or enjoyment of any part of the dominions of any government doth thereby give his tacit consent and is as far forth obliged to obedience to the laws of that government during such enjoyment as,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
368,by some public act cuts him off from being any longer a member of it sect 122 but submitting to the laws of any country living quietly and enjoying privileges and protection under them makes not a man a member of that society this is only a local protection and homage due to and from all those who not being in a state of war come within the territories belonging to any government to all parts whereof the force of its laws extends but this no more makes a man a member of that society a perpetual subject of that commonwealth than it would make a man a subject to another in whose family he found it convenient to abide for some time though whilst he continued in it he were obliged to comply with the laws and submit to the government he found there and thus we see that foreigners,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
369,settled known law received and allowed by common consent to be the standard of right and wrong and the common measure to decide all controversies between them for though the law of nature be plain and intelligible to all rational creatures yet men being biassed by their interest as well as ignorant for want of study of it are not apt to allow of it as a law binding to them in the application of it to their particular cases sect 125 secondly in the state of nature there wants a known and indifferent judge with authority to determine all differences according to the established law for every one in that state being both judge and executioner of the law of nature men being partial to themselves passion and revenge is very apt to carry them too far and with too much heat in their own cases as well as negligence,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
370,force to make good their injustice such resistance many times makes the punishment dangerous and frequently destructive to those who attempt it sect 127 thus mankind notwithstanding all the privileges of the state of nature being but in an ill condition while they remain in it are quickly driven into society hence it comes to pass that we seldom find any number of men live any time together in this state the inconveniencies that they are therein exposed to by the irregular and uncertain exercise of the power every man has of punishing the transgressions of others make them take sanctuary under the established laws of government and therein seek the preservation of their property it is this makes them so willingly give up every one his single power of punishing to be exercised by such alone as shall be appointed to it amongst them and by such rules as the,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

385,share in the legislature but upon a new choice this power of chusing must also be exercised by the people either at certain appointed seasons or else when they are summoned to it and in this latter case the power of convoking the legislative is ordinarily placed in the executive and has one of these two limitations in respect of time that either the original constitution requires their assembling and acting at certain intervals and then the executive power does nothing but ministerially issue directions for their electing and assembling according to due forms or else it is left to his prudence to call them by new elections when the occasions or exigencies of the public require the amendment of old or making of new laws or the redress or prevention of any inconveniencies that lie on or threaten the people sect 155 it may be demanded here what if the,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

532,had lost every point but when mrs phillips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged that she would not make herself uneasy i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a cardtable they must take their chances of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters mr wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh lady catherine de bourgh,JaneAustin,female,victorian
533,affair became public the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the longexpected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennets civilities the prospect of the netherfield ball was,JaneAustin,female,victorian
534,to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once no aunt no officers no news could be sought afterthe very shoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia chapter 18 till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in,JaneAustin,female,victorian
535,your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly i must not decide on my own performance he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton she answered in the affirmative and unable,JaneAustin,female,victorian
536,to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence and on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcys breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find,JaneAustin,female,victorian
537,one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of mr bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her,JaneAustin,female,victorian
538,too much when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon be married to mr bingley it was an animating subject and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly,JaneAustin,female,victorian
539,the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be,JaneAustin,female,victorian
540,towards those to whom he owes his preferment i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room many staredmany smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think,JaneAustin,female,victorian
541,and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable the rest of the evening brought her little amusement she was teased by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening there was no arguing upon such a project she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas,JaneAustin,female,victorian
542,declaration in form having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business on finding mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise mrs bennet answered instantly oh dearyescertainly i am sure lizzy will be very happyi am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you up,JaneAustin,female,victorian
543,mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said mr collins you must marry a clergyman like you must marry choose properly choose a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice,JaneAustin,female,victorian
544,rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect forbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive and,JaneAustin,female,victorian
545,is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs bennet alarmed lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these in everything else she is as goodnatured a girl as ever lived i will go directly to mr bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure she would,JaneAustin,female,victorian
546,your daughters lips instead of your own but we are all liable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise chapter 21 the discussion of mr collinss offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to,JaneAustin,female,victorian
547,his own doing he is his own master but you do not know all i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from you mr darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing,JaneAustin,female,victorian
548,were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them towards herself such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon but here she did injustice,JaneAustin,female,victorian
549,such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before the possibility of mr collinss fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to mr collins my dear charlotteimpossible the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she,JaneAustin,female,victorian
550,information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly,JaneAustin,female,victorian
551,longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of lovemaking relieved them from a great deal of his company the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state the very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of illhumour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of the sight of miss lucas was odious to her as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she,JaneAustin,female,victorian
552,writer that could give her any comfort miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others to carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she,JaneAustin,female,victorian
553,been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whatever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally wounded a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs bennets leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying oh that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but i will not repine it cannot last long he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason,JaneAustin,female,victorian
554,fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too good your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sisters warm affection nay said elizabeth this is not fair you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal goodwill you need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i,JaneAustin,female,victorian
555,there may be misery thoughtlessness want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution will do the business and do you impute it to either of those yes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem stop me whilst you can you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him yes in conjunction with his friend i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it your first position is false they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose,JaneAustin,female,victorian
556,have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistakenor at least it is light it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and,JaneAustin,female,victorian
557,in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she i am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in,JaneAustin,female,victorian
558,so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as often applied to feelings which arise from a halfhours acquaintance as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingleys love i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love oh yesof that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have,JaneAustin,female,victorian
559,pleasure unconnected with his general powers about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged they had therefore many acquaintances in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring mrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself on being made acquainted with the present mr darcys treatment of him she tried to remember some,JaneAustin,female,victorian
560,was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room as they went downstairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza that you certainly shall and i have another favour to ask you will you come and see me we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire i am not likely to leave kent for some time promise me therefore to come to hunsford elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit my father and maria are coming to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be as welcome as either of them the wedding took,JaneAustin,female,victorian
561,not a line did i receive in the meantime when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer i pity though i cannot help blaming her she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it,JaneAustin,female,victorian
562,the brother was now absolutely over she would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she,JaneAustin,female,victorian
563,at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay everything however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to,JaneAustin,female,victorian
564,to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower all was joy and kindness the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt their first object was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute inquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss,JaneAustin,female,victorian
565,unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself to work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed,JaneAustin,female,victorian

567,is mrs jenkinson who lives with them the other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little creature who would have thought that she could be so thin and small she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind why does she not come in oh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas she looks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well she will make him a very proper wife mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way at,JaneAustin,female,victorian
568,of rank preserved while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st jamess as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of,JaneAustin,female,victorian
569,examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer,JaneAustin,female,victorian
570,said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person pray what is your age with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age i am not oneandtwenty when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the cardtables were placed lady catherine sir william and mr and mrs collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her party their table was superlatively stupid scarcely a syllable was uttered that,JaneAustin,female,victorian
571,and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped,JaneAustin,female,victorian
572,much he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr darcy his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam what is it you are talking of what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it is we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply of music then pray speak aloud it is of,JaneAustin,female,victorian
573,it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her halffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy and mr darcy only entered the room he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within they then sat down and when her inquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to,JaneAustin,female,victorian
574,from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from her walk the teteatete surprised them mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody went away what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was gone my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called us in this familiar way but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit,JaneAustin,female,victorian

584,words so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err but when she read and reread with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with little success on both sides it was only assertion again she read on but every line proved more clearly,JaneAustin,female,victorian

768,think what you like of mei dont care a straw at the moment however speech or silence seemed immaterial and she merely clapped her hands together and looked at the distant woods with the rustlike bloom on their brown and the green and blue landscape through the steam of her own breath it seemed a mere tossup whether she said i love you or whether she said i love the beechtrees or only i lovei love do you know mary ralph suddenly interrupted her ive made up my mind her indifference must have been superficial for it disappeared at once indeed she lost sight of the trees and saw her own hand upon the topmost bar of the gate with extreme distinctness while he went on ive made up my mind to chuck my work and live down here i want you to tell me about that cottage you spoke of,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
769,cheerful hardness ignoring the whole of this statement youve got a little money havent you yes she concluded i dont see why it shouldnt be a very good plan they crossed the field in complete silence ralph was surprised by her remark and a little hurt and yet on the whole rather pleased he had convinced himself that it was impossible to lay his case truthfully before mary and secretly he was relieved to find that he had not parted with his dream to her she was as he had always found her the sensible loyal friend the woman he trusted whose sympathy he could count upon provided he kept within certain limits he was not displeased to find that those limits were very clearly marked when they had crossed the next hedge she said to him yes ralph its time you made a break ive come to the same conclusion,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
770,and to thrust back her assurance that she would forgive him till doomsday if he chose she was preserved from doing so only by a stubborn kind of respect for herself which lay at the root of her nature and forbade surrender even in moments of almost overwhelming passion now when all was tempest and highrunning waves she knew of a land where the sun shone clear upon italian grammars and files of docketed papers nevertheless from the skeleton pallor of that land and the rocks that broke its surface she knew that her life there would be harsh and lonely almost beyond endurance she walked steadily a little in front of him across the plowed field their way took them round the verge of a wood of thin trees standing at the edge of a steep fold in the land looking between the treetrunks ralph saw laid out on the,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
771,my study for you see mary im going to write a book here he withdrew his arm from hers lit his pipe and they tramped on in a sagacious kind of comradeship the most complete they had attained in all their friendship and whats your book to be about she said as boldly as if she had never come to grief with ralph in talking about books he told her unhesitatingly that he meant to write the history of the english village from saxon days to the present time some such plan had lain as a seed in his mind for many years and now that he had decided in a flash to give up his profession the seed grew in the space of twenty minutes both tall and lusty he was surprised himself at the positive way in which he spoke it was the same with the question of his,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
772,steadily and gravely at the backs of the two men at the next table with so little selfconsciousness that she could almost watch his mind placing one thought solidly upon the top of another she thought that she could feel him thinking through the shade of her fingers and she could anticipate the exact moment when he would put an end to his thought and turn a little in his chair and say well mary inviting her to take up the thread of thought where he had dropped it and at that very moment he turned just so and said well mary with the curious touch of diffidence which she loved in him she laughed and she explained her laugh on the spur of the moment by the look of the people in the street below there was a motorcar with an old lady swathed in blue veils and a ladys,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
773,exactly upon a little group of women looking in at the great windows of a large drapers shop this discipline having given him at least a superficial control of himself he was about to turn and ask the waiter to bring the bill when his eye was caught by a tall figure walking quickly along the opposite pavementa tall figure upright dark and commanding much detached from her surroundings she held her gloves in her left hand and the left hand was bare all this ralph noticed and enumerated and recognized before he put a name to the wholekatharine hilbery she seemed to be looking for somebody her eyes in fact scanned both sides of the street and for one second were raised directly to the bow window in which ralph stood but she looked away again instantly without giving any sign that she had seen him this sudden apparition had,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
774,morning standing at a window but i decided that it couldnt be you and it must have been you all the same yes i thought i saw youbut it wasnt you he replied this remark and the rough strain in his voice recalled to her memory so many difficult speeches and abortive meetings that she was jerked directly back to the london drawingroom the family relics and the teatable and at the same time recalled some halffinished or interrupted remark which she had wanted to make herself or to hear from himshe could not remember what it was i expect it was me she said i was looking for my mother it happens every time we come to lincoln in fact there never was a family so unable to take care of itself as ours is not that it very much matters because some one always turns up in the nick,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
775,he waited until the last sign of the carriage had disappeared beneath the curve of the road and they were left entirely alone to cloak their silence she read the writing on the obelisk to do which she had to walk completely round it she was murmuring a word to two of the pious ladys thanks above her breath when rodney joined her in silence they set out along the carttrack which skirted the verge of the trees to break the silence was exactly what rodney wished to do and yet could not do to his own satisfaction in company it was far easier to approach katharine alone with her the aloofness and force of her character checked all his natural methods of attack he believed that she had behaved very badly to him but each separate instance of unkindness seemed too petty to be advanced when they were alone together,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
776,difficulty in talking to henry though she noted these various complaints and determined philosophically to answer none of them although the last stung her to considerable irritation she wished to find out how deep his grievance lay none of these things seem to me to matter she said very well then i may as well hold my tongue he replied in themselves they dont seem to me to matter if they hurt you of course they matter she corrected herself scrupulously her tone of consideration touched him and he walked on in silence for a space and we might be so happy katharine he exclaimed impulsively and drew her arm through his she withdrew it directly as long as you let yourself feel like this we shall never be happy she said the harshness which henry had noticed was again unmistakable in her manner william flinched and was silent such severity,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
777,alone with her there was no stimulus from outside to draw his attention from his injury by a considerable effort of selfcontrol he forced himself to remain silent and to make himself distinguish what part of his pain was due to vanity what part to the certainty that no woman really loving him could speak thus what do i feel about katharine he thought to himself it was clear that she had been a very desirable and distinguished figure the mistress of her little section of the world but more than that she was the person of all others who seemed to him the arbitress of life the woman whose judgment was naturally right and steady as his had never been in spite of all his culture and then he could not see her come into a room without a sense of the flowing of robes of the flowering of blossoms,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
778,persisted there has been a change in the last few weeks you owe it to me to be honest katharine if i could i would she replied why did you tell me you would marry me then he demanded why indeed a moment of pessimism a sudden conviction of the undeniable prose of life a lapse of the illusion which sustains youth midway between heaven and earth a desperate attempt to reconcile herself with factsshe could only recall a moment as of waking from a dream which now seemed to her a moment of surrender but who could give reasons such as these for doing what she had done she shook her head very sadly but youre not a childyoure not a woman of moods rodney persisted you couldnt have accepted me if you hadnt loved me he cried a sense of her own misbehavior which she had succeeded in keeping,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
779,laughing it flashed across her in another moment she saw that he was in tears in her bewilderment at this apparition she stood aghast for a second with a desperate sense that this horror must at all costs be stopped she then put her arms about him drew his head for a moment upon her shoulder and led him on murmuring words of consolation until he heaved a great sigh they held fast to each other her tears too ran down her cheeks and were both quite silent noticing the difficulty with which he walked and feeling the same extreme lassitude in her own limbs she proposed that they should rest for a moment where the bracken was brown and shriveled beneath an oaktree he assented once more he gave a great sigh and wiped his eyes with a childlike unconsciousness and began to speak without a trace of his previous,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
780,it all myself at one time i was always asking myself absurd questions which came to nothing either what you want if i may say so is some occupation to take you out of yourself when this morbid mood comes on if it hadnt been for my poetry i assure you i should often have been very much in the same state myself to let you into a secret he continued with his little chuckle which now sounded almost assured ive often gone home from seeing you in such a state of nerves that i had to force myself to write a page or two before i could get you out of my head ask denham hell tell you how he met me one night hell tell you what a state he found me in katharine started with displeasure at the mention of ralphs name the thought of the conversation in,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
781,but he was more troubled by katharines appearance as she sat rapt in thought upon the ground than by his own there was something improper to him in her selfforgetfulness a man naturally alive to the conventions of society he was strictly conventional where women were concerned and especially if the women happened to be in any way connected with him he noticed with distress the long strand of dark hair touching her shoulder and two or three dead beechleaves attached to her dress but to recall her mind in their present circumstances to a sense of these details was impossible she sat there seeming unconscious of everything he suspected that in her silence she was reproaching herself but he wished that she would think of her hair and of the dead beechleaves which were of more immediate importance to him than anything else indeed these trifles drew his attention strangely,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
782,distressingly illordered scene he rose abruptly and helped katharine to her feet she smiled a little at the minute care with which he tidied her and yet when he brushed the dead leaves from his own coat she flinched seeing in that action the gesture of a lonely man william she said i will marry you i will try to make you happy chapter xix the afternoon was already growing dark when the two other wayfarers mary and ralph denham came out on the high road beyond the outskirts of lincoln the high road as they both felt was better suited to this return journey than the open country and for the first mile or so of the way they spoke little in his own mind ralph was following the passage of the otway carriage over the heath he then went back to the five or ten minutes that he had,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
783,her love so involuntarily revealed to ralph in the light of reason it did not much matter perhaps but it was her instinct to be careful of that vision of herself which keeps pace so evenly beside every one of us and had been damaged by her confession the gray night coming down over the country was kind to her and she thought that one of these days she would find comfort in sitting upon the earth alone beneath a tree looking through the darkness she marked the swelling ground and the tree ralph made her start by saying abruptly what i was going to say when we were interrupted at lunch was that if you go to america i shall come too it cant be harder to earn a living there than it is here however thats not the point the point is mary that i want to marry you,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
784,and ralph merely the shell of an honest man oh the pastso much made up of ralph and now as she saw made up of something strange and false and other than she had thought it she tried to recapture a saying she had made to help herself that morning as ralph paid the bill for luncheon but she could see him paying the bill more vividly than she could remember the phrase something about truth was in it how to see the truth is our great chance in this world if you dont want to marry me ralph now began again without abruptness with diffidence rather there is no need why we should cease to see each other is there or would you rather that we should keep apart for the present keep apart i dont knowi must think about it tell me one thing mary he resumed have i,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
785,what firmness she could muster i shall want your friendship he said he added if you find it possible let me see you as often as you can the oftener the better i shall want your help she promised this and they went on to talk calmly of things that had no reference to their feelingsa talk which in its constraint was infinitely sad to both of them one more reference was made to the state of things between them late that night when elizabeth had gone to her room and the two young men had stumbled off to bed in such a state of sleep that they hardly felt the floor beneath their feet after a days shooting mary drew her chair a little nearer to the fire for the logs were burning low and at this time of night it was hardly worth while to replenish them ralph was,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

788,volunteer no longer she had renounced something and was nowhow could she express itnot quite in the running for life she had always known that mr clacton and mrs seal were not in the running and across the gulf that separated them she had seen them in the guise of shadow people flitting in and out of the ranks of the livingeccentrics undeveloped human beings from whose substance some essential part had been cut away all this had never struck her so clearly as it did this afternoon when she felt that her lot was cast with them for ever one view of the world plunged in darkness so a more volatile temperament might have argued after a season of despair let the world turn again and show another more splendid perhaps no mary thought with unflinching loyalty to what appeared to her to be the true view having lost what,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
789,on either side of her had hypnotized her into a mood of profound despondency to which her expectation of an evening alone with rodney contributed they were very good friends again better friends they both said than ever before so far as she was concerned this was true there were many more things in him than she had guessed until emotion brought them forthstrength affection sympathy and she thought of them and looked at the faces passing and thought how much alike they were and how distant nobody feeling anything as she felt nothing and distance she thought lay inevitably between the closest and their intimacy was the worst presence of all for oh dear she thought looking into a tobacconists window i dont care for any of them and i dont care for william and people say this is the thing that matters most and i cant see what they,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

791,it impossible to press her to reveal more of this exalted condition she could only respect the fact that in some few cases life arranged itself thus satisfactorily and pass on she rose to her feet accordingly but mary exclaimed with unmistakable earnestness that she must not go that they met so seldom that she wanted to talk to her so much katharine was surprised at the earnestness with which she spoke it seemed to her that there could be no indiscretion in mentioning ralph by name seating herself for ten minutes she said by the way mr denham told me he was going to give up the bar and live in the country has he gone he was beginning to tell me about it when we were interrupted he thinks of it said mary briefly the color at once came to her face it would be a very good plan,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
792,she had no need to verify the mistake by a glance at her own recollections when the fact was so clearly stamped upon her mind that if ralph had any feeling towards her it was one of critical hostility she did not give the matter another thought and mary now that she had stated the fact did not seek to prove it but tried to explain to herself rather than to katharine her motives in making the statement she had nerved herself to do what some large and imperious instinct demanded her doing she had been swept on the breast of a wave beyond her reckoning ive told you she said because i want you to help me i dont want to be jealous of you and i amim fearfully jealous the only way i thought was to tell you she hesitated and groped in her endeavor to make her feelings,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
793,of clothes and busied himself with the plates ive got a piece of news for you katharine he said directly they sat down to table i shant get my holiday in april we shall have to put off our marriage he rapped the words out with a certain degree of briskness katharine started a little as if the announcement disturbed her thoughts that wont make any difference will it i mean the lease isnt signed she replied but why what has happened he told her in an offhand way how one of his fellowclerks had broken down and might have to be away for months six months even in which case they would have to think over their position he said it in a way which struck her at last as oddly casual she looked at him there was no outward sign that he was annoyed with her was she well,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
794,as if when her train of thought was ended she became aware of his presence have you finished your letter she asked he thought he heard faint amusement in her tone but not a trace of jealousy no im not going to write any more tonight he said im not in the mood for it for some reason i cant say what i want to say cassandra wont know if its well written or badly written katharine remarked im not so sure about that i should say she has a good deal of literary feeling perhaps said katharine indifferently youve been neglecting my education lately by the way i wish youd read something let me choose a book so speaking she went across to his bookshelves and began looking in a desultory way among his books anything she thought was better than bickering or the strange silence which drove home to,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

1144,capable of so frightful so appalling a crime justine moritz poor poor girl is she the accused but it is wrongfully every one knows that no one believes it surely ernest no one did at first but several circumstances came out that have almost forced conviction upon us and her own behaviour has been so confused as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that i fear leaves no hope for doubt but she will be tried today and you will then hear all he then related that the morning on which the murder of poor william had been discovered justine had been taken ill and confined to her bed for several days during this interval one of the servants happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother which had been judged to,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1145,other far more dreadfully murdered with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave and i the cause a thousand times rather would i have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to justine but i was absent when it was committed and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me the appearance of justine was calm she was dressed in mourning and her countenance always engaging was rendered by the solemnity of her feelings exquisitely beautiful yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble although gazed on and execrated by thousands for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1146,round his neck a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court justine was called on for her defence as the trial had proceeded her countenance had altered surprise horror and misery were strongly expressed sometimes she struggled with her tears but when she was desired to plead she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice god knows she said how entirely i am innocent but i do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me i rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me and i hope the character i have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious she then related that by the permission of elizabeth she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1147,in a barn belonging to a cottage being unwilling to call up the inhabitants to whom she was well known most of the night she spent here watching towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes some steps disturbed her and she awoke it was dawn and she quitted her asylum that she might again endeavour to find my brother if she had gone near the spot where his body lay it was without her knowledge that she had been bewildered when questioned by the marketwoman was not surprising since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor william was yet uncertain concerning the picture she could give no account i know continued the unhappy victim how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me but i have no power of explaining it and when i have expressed my utter ignorance i am only,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1148,jewel to part with it again so soon i commit my cause to the justice of my judges yet i see no room for hope i beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt i must be condemned although i would pledge my salvation on my innocence several witnesses were called who had known her for many years and they spoke well of her but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward elizabeth saw even this last resource her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct about to fail the accused when although violently agitated she desired permission to address the court i am said she the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered or rather his sister for i was educated by and have lived,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1149,one guilty should escape but she has confessed this was a dire blow to poor elizabeth who had relied with firmness upon justines innocence alas said she how shall i ever again believe in human goodness justine whom i loved and esteemed as my sister how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile and yet she has committed a murder soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin my father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide yes said elizabeth i will go although she is guilty and you victor shall accompany me i cannot go alone the idea of this visit was torture to me yet i could not refuse we entered the gloomy prison chamber,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1150,world and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned i am resigned to the fate awaiting me learn from me dear lady to submit in patience to the will of heaven during this conversation i had retired to a corner of the prison room where i could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me despair who dared talk of that the poor victim who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death felt not as i did such deep and bitter agony i gnashed my teeth and ground them together uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul justine started when she saw who it was she approached me and said dear sir you are very kind to visit me you i hope do not believe that i am guilty i could not answer no justine said elizabeth he,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1151,no hope or consolation elizabeth also wept and was unhappy but hers also was the misery of innocence which like a cloud that passes over the fair moon for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart i bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish we stayed several hours with justine and it was with great difficulty that elizabeth could tear herself away i wish cried she that i were to die with you i cannot live in this world of misery justine assumed an air of cheerfulness while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears she embraced elizabeth and said in a voice of halfsuppressed emotion farewell sweet lady dearest elizabeth my beloved and only friend may heaven in its bounty bless and preserve you may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer live,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1152,fled from my eyes i wandered like an evil spirit for i had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible and more much more i persuaded myself was yet behind yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue i had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when i should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings now all was blasted instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with selfsatisfaction and from thence to gather promise of new hopes i was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe this state of mind preyed upon my health which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained i shunned the face of man,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1153,might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of william and justine our house was the house of mourning my fathers health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events elizabeth was sad and desponding she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed she was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects the first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles when i reflect my dear cousin said she on the miserable death of justine moritz i no,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1154,a creature unfit to remain in the society of men but she was innocent i know i feel she was innocent you are of the same opinion and that confirms me alas victor when falsehood can look so like the truth who can assure themselves of certain happiness i feel as if i were walking on the edge of a precipice towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss william and justine were assassinated and the murderer escapes he walks about the world free and perhaps respected but even if i were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes i would not change places with such a wretch i listened to this discourse with the extremest agony i not in deed but in effect was the true murderer elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance and kindly taking my hand said my dearest,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1155,how deeply but i am not so wretched as you are there is an expression of despair and sometimes of revenge in your countenance that makes me tremble dear victor banish these dark passions remember the friends around you who centre all their hopes in you have we lost the power of rendering you happy ah while we love while we are true to each other here in this land of peace and beauty your native country we may reap every tranquil blessingwhat can disturb our peace and could not such words from her whom i fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart even as she spoke i drew near to her as if in terror lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her thus not the tenderness of friendship nor the,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1156,wreck but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes i performed the first part of my journey on horseback i afterwards hired a mule as the more surefooted and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads the weather was fine it was about the middle of the month of august nearly two months after the death of justine that miserable epoch from which i dated all my woe the weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as i plunged yet deeper in the ravine of arve the immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side the sound of the river raging among the rocks and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as omnipotenceand i ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements here displayed in their most terrific,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1157,fashion i alighted and threw myself on the grass weighed down by horror and despair at length i arrived at the village of chamounix exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which i had endured for a short space of time i remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above mont blanc and listening to the rushing of the arve which pursued its noisy way beneath the same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations when i placed my head upon my pillow sleep crept over me i felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion chapter 10 i spent the following day roaming through the valley i stood beside the sources of the arveiron which take their rise in a glacier that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1158,icy wall of the glacier overhung me a few shattered pines were scattered around and the solemn silence of this glorious presencechamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking reverberated along the mountains of the accumulated ice which through the silent working of immutable laws was ever and anon rent and torn as if it had been but a plaything in their hands these sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that i was capable of receiving they elevated me from all littleness of feeling and although they did not remove my grief they subdued and tranquillised it in some degree also they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month i retired to rest at night my slumbers as it were waited,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic

1160,like his morrow nought may endure but mutability it was nearly noon when i arrived at the top of the ascent for some time i sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice a mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains presently a breeze dissipated the cloud and i descended upon the glacier the surface is very uneven rising like the waves of a troubled sea descending low and interspersed by rifts that sink deep the field of ice is almost a league in width but i spent nearly two hours in crossing it the opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock from the side where i now stood montanvert was exactly opposite at the distance of a league and above it rose mont blanc in awful majesty i remained in a recess of the rock gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene the sea or rather the,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic

1163,come to the hut upon the mountain the sun is yet high in the heavens before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world you will have heard my story and can decide on you it rests whether i quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin as he said this he led the way across the ice i followed my heart was full and i did not answer him but as i proceeded i weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale i was partly urged by curiosity and compassion confirmed my resolution i had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother and i eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1164,then came over me and troubled me but hardly had i felt this when by opening my eyes as i now suppose the light poured in upon me again i walked and i believe descended but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations before dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me impervious to my touch or sight but i now found that i could wander on at liberty with no obstacles which i could not either surmount or avoid the light became more and more oppressive to me and the heat wearying me as i walked i sought a place where i could receive shade this was the forest near ingolstadt and here i lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst this roused me from my nearly dormant state and i ate some berries which i found,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1165,of the radiant roof of light which canopied me sometimes i tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again the moon had disappeared from the night and again with a lessened form showed itself while i still remained in the forest my sensations had by this time become distinct and my mind received every day additional ideas my eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms i distinguished the insect from the herb and by degrees one herb from another i found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing one day when i was oppressed by cold i found a fire which had,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1166,with delight at the warmth i experienced from it in my joy i thrust my hand into the live embers but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain how strange i thought that the same cause should produce such opposite effects i examined the materials of the fire and to my joy found it to be composed of wood i quickly collected some branches but they were wet and would not burn i was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire the wet wood which i had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed i reflected on this and by touching the various branches i discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood that i might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire when night came on and brought sleep with it i was,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1167,be more easily satisfied in this emigration i exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which i had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it i gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty but i was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it and wrapping myself up in my cloak i struck across the wood towards the setting sun i passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country a great fall of snow had taken place the night before and the fields were of one uniform white the appearance was disconsolate and i found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground it was about seven in the morning and i longed to obtain food and shelter at length i perceived a small hut on a rising ground which had doubtless been built for the,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1168,my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power i had first however provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread which i purloined and a cup with which i could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat the floor was a little raised so that it was kept perfectly dry and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm being thus provided i resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination it was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest my former residence the raindropping branches and dank earth i ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when i heard a step and looking through a small chink i beheld,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1169,with a pail on her head passing before my hovel the girl was young and of gentle demeanour unlike what i have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be yet she was meanly dressed a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb her fair hair was plaited but not adorned she looked patient yet sad i lost sight of her and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail which was now partly filled with milk as she walked along seemingly incommoded by the burden a young man met her whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself she followed and they disappeared presently i saw the young man again with some tools in his hand cross the field behind the,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1170,the thrush or the nightingale it was a lovely sight even to me poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love he played a sweet mournful air which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion of which the old man took no notice until she sobbed audibly he then pronounced a few sounds and the fair creature leaving her work knelt at his feet he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature they were a mixture of pain and pleasure such as i had never before experienced either from hunger or cold warmth or food and i withdrew from the window unable to bear these emotions soon after this the young,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1171,instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning so soon as he had finished the youth began not to play but to utter sounds that were monotonous and neither resembling the harmony of the old mans instrument nor the songs of the birds i since found that he read aloud but at that time i knew nothing of the science of words or letters the family after having been thus occupied for a short time extinguished their lights and retired as i conjectured to rest chapter 12 i lay on my straw but i could not sleep i thought of the occurrences of the day what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people and i longed to join them but dared not i remembered too well the treatment i had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers and resolved whatever course of,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1172,they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves this trait of kindness moved me sensibly i had been accustomed during the night to steal a part of their store for my own consumption but when i found that in doing this i inflicted pain on the cottagers i abstained and satisfied myself with berries nuts and roots which i gathered from a neighbouring wood i discovered also another means through which i was enabled to assist their labours i found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire and during the night i often took his tools the use of which i quickly discovered and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days i remember the first time that i did this the young woman when she opened the door in the morning appeared greatly,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1173,to his perpetual astonishment he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand in the day i believe he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer because he often went forth and did not return until dinner yet brought no wood with him at other times he worked in the garden but as there was little to do in the frosty season he read to the old man and agatha this reading had puzzled me extremely at first but by degrees i discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked i conjectured therefore that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood and i ardently longed to comprehend these also but how was that possible when i did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs i improved however sensibly in this science but not sufficiently to,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic

1175,the lovely stranger and pointing to her brother made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came some hours passed thus while they by their countenances expressed joy the cause of which i did not comprehend presently i found by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them that she was endeavouring to learn their language and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the same instructions to the same end the stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson most of them indeed were those which i had before understood but i profited by the others as night came on agatha and the arabian retired early when they separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said good night sweet safie he sat up much longer conversing with his father and by,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1176,arabian sat at the feet of the old man and taking his guitar played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes she sang and her voice flowed in a rich cadence swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods when she had finished she gave the guitar to agatha who at first declined it she played a simple air and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger the old man appeared enraptured and said some words which agatha endeavoured to explain to safie and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music the days now passed as peaceably as before with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends safie was,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1177,like me was i then a monster a blot upon the earth from which all men fled and whom all men disowned i cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me i tried to dispel them but sorrow only increased with knowledge oh that i had for ever remained in my native wood nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger thirst and heat of what a strange nature is knowledge it clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock i wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling but i learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain and that was deatha state which i feared yet did not understand i admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers but i was,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1178,no father had watched my infant days no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses or if they had all my past life was now a blot a blind vacancy in which i distinguished nothing from my earliest remembrance i had been as i then was in height and proportion i had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me what was i the question again recurred to be answered only with groans i will soon explain to what these feelings tended but allow me now to return to the cottagers whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation delight and wonder but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors for so i loved in an innocent halfpainful selfdeceit to call them chapter 14 some time elapsed before i learned the history of my friends it was one,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic

1181,society was enchanting to her the day for the execution of the turk was fixed but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from paris felix had procured passports in the name of his father sister and himself he had previously communicated his plan to the former who aided the deceit by quitting his house under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself with his daughter in an obscure part of paris felix conducted the fugitives through france to lyons and across mont cenis to leghorn where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the turkish dominions safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure before which time the turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer and felix remained with them in,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1182,was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the italian state which they inhabited he revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed his plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from paris the government of france were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer the plot of felix was quickly discovered and de lacey and agatha were thrown into prison the news reached felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure his blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved this idea was torture to him,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1183,however into good hands the italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover chapter 15 such was the history of my beloved cottagers it impressed me deeply i learned from the views of social life which it developed to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind as yet i looked upon crime as a distant evil benevolence and generosity were ever present before me inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed but in giving an account of the progress of my intellect i must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of august of,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1184,to the beings concerning whom i read and to whose conversation i was a listener i sympathised with and partly understood them but i was unformed in mind i was dependent on none and related to none the path of my departure was free and there was none to lament my annihilation my person was hideous and my stature gigantic what did this mean who was i what was i whence did i come what was my destination these questions continually recurred but i was unable to solve them the volume of plutarchs lives which i possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics this book had a far different effect upon me from the sorrows of werter i learned from werters imaginations despondency and gloom but plutarch taught me high thoughts he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections to admire and love,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1185,mind perhaps if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier burning for glory and slaughter i should have been imbued with different sensations but paradise lost excited different and far deeper emotions i read it as i had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands as a true history it moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent god warring with his creatures was capable of exciting i often referred the several situations as their similarity struck me to my own like adam i was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence but his state was far different from mine in every other respect he had come forth from the hands of god a perfect creature happy and prosperous guarded by the especial care of his creator he was allowed to converse with and,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1186,with a dread lest i should fail besides i found that my understanding improved so much with every days experience that i was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity several changes in the meantime took place in the cottage the presence of safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants and i also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there felix and agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation and were assisted in their labours by servants they did not appear rich but they were contented and happy their feelings were serene and peaceful while mine became every day more tumultuous increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast i was i cherished hope it is true but it vanished when i beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine even,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
