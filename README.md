# nlp-authorship-vectorization


We utilized doc2vec and other NLP processing tools to explore whether we could classify authorship by sex, period, and author<br>


There's definitely some refactoring that we'd like to do given the time (a lot of code copy and pasted that could be functionalized).<br>
