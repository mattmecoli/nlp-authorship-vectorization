1,always the same in the immutability of their surroundings the foreign shores the foreign faces the changing immensity of life glide past veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as destiny for the rest after his hours of work a casual stroll or a casual spree on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing the yarns of seamen have a direct simplicity the whole meaning of which lies within the shell of a cracked nut but was not typical if his propensity to spin yarns be excepted and to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside enveloping the tale which,JosephConrad,male,early_modernism

5,while on the other hand the steamer fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic in charge of the engineer i believe afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much about freslevens remains till i got out and stepped into his shoes i couldnt let it rest though but when an opportunity offered at last to meet my predecessor the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough to hide his bones they were all there the supernatural being had not been touched after he fell and the village was deserted the huts gaped black rotting all askew within the fallen enclosures a calamity had come to it sure enough the people had vanished mad terror had scattered them men women and children through the bush and they had never returned what became of the hens i dont know either i should think the cause of progress got them anyhow however through this,JosephConrad,male,early_modernism

57,it later on it was not something for which could be sacked on the spot and it seemed to much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying but the others didnt know what was happening they were worried that would excuse their behaviour the chief clerk now raised his voice he called to him what is wrong you barricade yourself in your room give us no more than yes or no for an answer you are causing serious and unnecessary concern to your parents and you fail and i mention this just by the way you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of im speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer and really must request a clear and immediate explanation i am astonished quite astonished i thought i,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism

59,shocked then it would no longer be gregors responsibility and he could rest if however they took everything calmly he would still have no reason to be upset and if he hurried he really could be at the station for eight oclock the first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again but he finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs by now he had also calmed down and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying did you understand a word of all that the chief clerk asked,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
60,very quiet in the next room perhaps his parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk or perhaps they were all pressed against the door and listening slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs he rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth he seemed unfortunately to have no proper teeth how was he then to grasp the key but the lack of teeth was of course made up for with a very strong jaw using the jaw he really was able to start the key turning ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism

62,i will work my way out of it again please dont make things any harder for me than they are already and dont take sides against me at the office i know that nobody likes the travellers they think we earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it thats just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it but you sir you have a better overview than the rest of the staff in fact if i can say this in confidence a better overview than the boss himself its very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should and youre also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
63,in tears while was still lying peacefully on his back and the chief clerk was a lover of women surely she could persuade him she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state but his sister was not there would have to do the job himself and without considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state or that his speech still might not or probably would not be understood he let go of the door pushed himself through the opening tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who ridiculously was holding on to the banister with both hands but fell immediately over and with a little scream as he sought something to hold onto landed on his numerous little legs hardly had that happened than for the first time that,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
64,already reached the stairs with his chin on the banister he looked back for the last time made a run for him he wanted to be sure of reaching him the chief clerk must have expected something as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared his shouts resounding all around the staircase the flight of the chief clerk seemed unfortunately to put gregors father into a panic as well until then he had been relatively self controlled but now instead of running after the chief clerk himself or at least not impeding as he ran after him gregors father seized the chief clerks stick in his right hand the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair along with his hat and overcoat picked up a large newspaper from the table with his left and used them to drive back into his room stamping his foot at him,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
65,turn if only his father would stop that unbearable hissing it was making quite confused when he had nearly finished turning round still listening to that hissing he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come he was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway but then saw that it was too narrow and his body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty in his present mood it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so that would have enough space to get through he was merely fixed on the idea that should be got back into his room as quickly as possible nor would he ever have allowed the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway what he did making more noise,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
66,with the stick then finally all was quiet ii it was not until it was getting dark that evening that awoke from his deep and comalike sleep he would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadnt been disturbed as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested but he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him the light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture but down below where was it was dark he pushed himself over to the door feeling his way clumsily with his antennae of which he was now beginning to learn the value in order to see what had been happening there the whole of his left side seemed like one painfully stretched scar and he,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
67,in the door could see that the gas had been lit in the living room his father at this time would normally be sat with his evening paper reading it out in a loud voice to gregors mother and sometimes to his sister but there was now not a sound to be heard gregors sister would often write and tell him about this reading but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times it was so quiet all around too even though there must have been somebody in the flat what a quiet life it is the family lead said to himself and gazing into the darkness felt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and parents but what now if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
68,hunger and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which however always led to the same conclusion for the time being he must remain calm he must show patience and the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he in his present condition was forced to impose on them soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions as early the had ended his sister nearly fully dressed opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in she did not see him straight away but when she did notice him under the couch he had to be somewhere for gods sake he couldnt have flown away she was so shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut again from outside but she seemed to regret her behaviour as she opened the door again straight away,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism

70,would send the maid away on some errand gregors father and mother certainly did not want him to starve either but perhaps it would have been more than they could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being told about it and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough it was impossible for to find out what they had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat as nobody could understand him nobody not even his sister thought that he could understand them so he had to be content to hear his sisters sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room it was only later when she had become a little more used to everything there was of course no question of her ever becoming fully,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
71,a friendly comment or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly enjoyed his dinner today she might say when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him or if he left most of it which slowly became more and more frequent she would often say sadly now everythings just been left there again although wasnt able to hear any news directly he did listen to much of what was said in the next rooms and whenever he heard anyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his whole body against it there was seldom any conversation especially at first that was not about him in some way even if only in secret for two whole days all the talk at every mealtime was about what they should do now but even between meals they spoke about the same subject as there,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
72,answer than no thanks ive had enough or something similar drank very much either his sister would sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer hoping for the chance to go and fetch it herself when his father then said nothing she would add so that he would not feel selfish that she could send the housekeeper for it but then his father would close the matter with a big loud no and no more would be said even before the first day had come to an end his father had explained to gregors mother and sister what their finances and prospects were now and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from his business when it had collapsed five years earlier heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
73,representative almost overnight bringing with it the chance to earn money in quite different ways converted his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished and delighted family they had been good times and they had never come again at least not with the same splendour even though had later earned so much that he was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family and did bear them they had even got used to it both and the family they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it although there was no longer much warm affection given in return only remained close to his sister now unlike him she was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist it was his secret plan to send her to the conservatory,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
74,they would all go silent whats that hes doing now his father would say after a while clearly having gone over to the door and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again when explaining things his father repeated himself several times partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these matters himself and partly because gregors mother did not understand everything the first time from these repeated explanations learned to his pleasure that despite all their misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days it was not a lot but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated besides that they had not been using up all the money that had been bringing home every month keeping only a little for himself so that that too had been accumulating behind the door nodded with,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
75,it was a strain for her just to move about the home every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window would his sister have to go and earn money she was still a child of seventeen her life up till then had been very enviable consisting of wearing nice clothes sleeping late helping out in the business joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money would always first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool leather sofa next to it as he became quite hot with shame and regret he would often lie there the whole night through not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end or he might go to all the effort of pushing,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
76,chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on if had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it but as it was it caused him pain his sister naturally tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it and the longer it went on of course the better she was able to do so but as time went by was also able to see through it all so much better it had even become very unpleasant for him now whenever she entered the room no sooner had she come in than she would quickly close the door,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
77,one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his sister liked the new arrangement for parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to see him he would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though before they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her but now the two of them father and mother would often both wait outside the door of gregors room while his sister tidied up in there and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked what had eaten how he had behaved this time and whether perhaps any slight improvement could be seen his mother also wanted to go in and visit relatively soon but his father and sister at first,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
78,being seen at the window during the day the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about it was hard to just lie quietly through the night his food soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all and so to entertain himself he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling he was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling it was quite different from lying on the floor he could breathe more freely his body had a light swing to it and up there relaxed and almost happy it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash but now of course he had far better control of his body than before and even with a fall as great as that caused himself no damage,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
79,only then did she let her mother enter had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance also refrained this time from spying out from under the sheet he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come you can come in he cant be seen said his sister obviously leading her in by the hand the old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about but listened as they pushed it from its place his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for herself and ignoring her mothers warnings that she would strain herself this lasted a very long time after labouring at it for fifteen minutes or,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
80,still been human he had come very close to forgetting and it had only been the voice of his mother unheard for so long that had shaken him out of it nothing should be removed everything had to stay he could not do without the good influence the furniture had on his condition and if the furniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage his sister unfortunately did not agree she had become used to the idea not without reason that she was spokesman to his parents about the things that concerned him this meant that his mothers advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk as she had thought at first but all the furniture apart from the allimportant couch it was more than childish perversity of,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
81,more shocking than it was so that she could do even more for him grete would probably be the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by crawling about the bare walls by himself so she refused to let her mother dissuade her gregors mother already looked uneasy in his room she soon stopped speaking and helped gregors sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she had the chest of drawers was something that could do without if he had to but the writing desk had to stay hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers groaning out of the room than poked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about it he meant to be as careful and considerate as he could but unfortunately it was his mother who came back first while in the next,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
82,he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a little it was enough to attract his mothers attention she stood very still remained there a moment and then went back out to kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was happening it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro their little calls to each other the scraping of the furniture on the floor all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides with his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to the floor he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand all of this much longer they were emptying his room out taking away everything that was dear to him they had already,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
83,calm bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice come on lets go back in the living room for a while could see what had in mind she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down from the wall well she could certainly try it he sat unyielding on his picture he would rather jump at gretes face but words had made her mother quite worried she stepped to one side saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper and before she even realised it was that she saw screamed oh god oh god arms outstretched she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile shouted his sister glowering at him and shaking her fist that was the first word she had,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
84,of her faint wanted to help too he could save his picture later although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force then he too ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in the old days but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing she was looking into various bottles he startled her when she turned round a bottle fell to the ground and broke a splinter cut gregors face some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him now without delaying any longer took hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother she slammed the door shut with her foot so now was shut out from his mother who because of him might be near to death he could not open the door if he did not want to,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
85,he lay there for a while numb and immobile all around him it was quiet maybe that was a good sign then there was someone at the door the maid of course had locked herself in her kitchen so that would have to go and answer it his father had arrived home whats happened were his first words gretes appearance must have made everything clear to him she answered him with subdued voice and openly pressed her face into his chest mothers fainted but shes better now got out just as i expected said his father just as i always said but you women wouldnt listen would you it was clear to that had not said enough and that his father took it to mean that something bad had happened that he was responsible for some act of violence that meant would now have to try to calm his father as,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
86,wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his companions around him he was standing up straight enough now dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute above the high stiff collar of the coat his strong doublechin emerged under the bushy eyebrows his piercing dark eyes looked out fresh and alert his normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp he took his cap with its gold monogram from probably some bank and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa put his hands in his trouser pockets pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat and with look of determination walked towards gregor he probably did not even know himself what he had in mind but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high was amazed at the enormous size,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
87,the time for careful aim threw one apple after another these little red apples rolled about on the floor knocking into each other as if they had electric motors an apple thrown without much force glanced against gregors back and slid off without doing any harm another one however immediately following it hit squarely and lodged in his back wanted to drag himself away as if he could remove the surprising the incredible pain by changing his position but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out all his senses in confusion the last thing he saw was the door of his room being pulled open his sister was screaming his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse as his sister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her to breathe she ran to his,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
88,and his condition seemed serious enough to remind even his father that despite his current sad and revolting form was a family member who could not be treated as an enemy on the contrary as a family there was a duty to swallow any revulsion for him and to be patient just to be patient because of his injuries had lost much of his mobility probably permanently he had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and it took him long long minutes to crawl across his room crawling over the ceiling was out of the question but this deterioration in his condition was fully in his opinion made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening he got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then lying in the darkness of his,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism
89,on sometimes his father would wake up and say to gregors mother youre doing so much sewing again today as if he did not know that he had been dozing and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin with a kind of stubbornness gregors father refused to take his uniform off even at home while his nightgown hung unused on its peg gregors father would slumber where he was fully dressed as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even here the uniform had not been new to start with but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of gregors mother and sister to look after it gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat with its gold buttons always kept,FranzKafka,male,early_modernism

355,expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake chapter ii the pool of tears curiouser and curiouser cried she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now im opening out like the largest telescope that ever was goodbye feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears im sure i shant be able i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you canbut i must be kind to them thought,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
356,alices love oh dear what nonsense im talking just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again you ought to be ashamed of yourself said a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way stop this moment i tell you but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall after a time,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
357,rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is today and yesterday things went on just as usual i wonder if ive been changed in the night let me think was i the same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little different but if im not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah thats the great puzzle and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them im sure im not she said,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
358,twenty at that rate however the doesnt signify lets try is the capital of and is the capital of and romeno thats all wrong im certain i must have been changed for try and say how doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws im sure those are not the right words said poor and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on i must be after all and i shall have to go and,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
359,the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never and i declare its too bad that it is as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by railway she said to herself had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station however she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
360,youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her she is such a dear quiet thing went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her faceand she is such a nice soft thing to nurseand shes such a capital one for catching miceoh i beg your pardon cried again for this time the was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended we wont talk about her any more if youd rather not we indeed cried the who was trembling down to the end of his tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things dont let me hear the name again i wont indeed said in a great hurry to change the subject of,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
361,there were a duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures led the way and the whole party swam to the shore chapter iii a and a long tale they were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on the bankthe birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable the first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life indeed she had quite a long argument with the who at last turned sulky and would only say i am older than you and must know better and this would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the lory,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
362,do it and as you might like to try the thing yourself some day i will tell you how the dodo managed it first it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle the exact shape doesnt matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there there was no one two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out the race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who has won this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
363,nothing to do said the mouse to the cur such a trial dear sir with no jury or judge would be wasting our breath ill be judge ill be jury said cunning old fury ill try the whole cause and condemn you to death you are not attending said the to severely what are you thinking of i beg your pardon said very humbly you had got to the fifth bend i think i had not cried the sharply and very angrily a knot said always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her oh do let me help to undo it i shall do nothing of the sort said the getting up and walking away you insult me by talking such nonsense i didnt mean it pleaded poor alice but youre so easily offended you know the only growled in reply please come back and finish your story,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
364,i have dropped them i wonder guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely very soon the rabbit noticed as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone why what are you doing out here run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now and was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made he took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran how surprised hell be when,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
365,neck from being broken she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself thats quite enoughi hope i shant grow any moreas it is i cant get out at the doori do wish i hadnt drunk quite so much alas it was too late to wish that she went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more whatever happens what will become of me luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
366,me that there ought and when i grow up ill write onebut im grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more here but then thought shall i never get any older than i am now thatll be a comfort one waynever to be an old womanbut thenalways to have lessons to learn oh i shouldnt like that oh you foolish she answered herself how can you learn lessons in here why theres hardly room for you and no room at all for any lessonbooks and so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen said the voice fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs knew it,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
367,for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words wheres the other ladderwhy i hadnt to bring but one bills got the otherbill fetch it here ladhere put em up at this cornerno tie em together firstthey dont reach half high enough yetoh theyll do well enough dont be particularhere bill catch hold of this ropewill the roof bearmind that loose slateoh its coming down heads below a loud crashnow who did thatit was bill i fancywhos to go down the chimneynay i shant you do itthat i wont thenbills to go downhere bill the master says youre to go down the chimney oh so bills got to come down the chimney has he said to herself shy they seem to put everything upon bill i wouldnt be in,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
368,out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside the poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up by two guineapigs who were giving it something out of a bottle they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood the first thing ive got to do said to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i think that will be the best plan it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
369,till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut this seemed to a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance and yet what a dear little puppy it was said as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves i should have liked teaching it tricks very much ifif id only been the right size to do it oh dear id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again let me seehow is it to be managed i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is what the great question certainly was,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
370,knowand then after that into a butterfly i should think youll feel it a little queer wont you not a bit said the perhaps your feelings may be different said all i know is it would feel very queer to me you said the contemptuously who are you which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation felt a little irritated at the caterpillars making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are first why said the was another puzzling question and as could not think of any good reason and as the seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind she turned away come back the called after her ive something important to say this sounded promising certainly turned and came back again keep your temper said the is that all,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
371,old said the youth as i mentioned before and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door pray what is the reason of that in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointmentone shilling the box allow me to sell you a couple you are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak pray how did you manage to do it in my youth said his father i took to the law and argued each case with my wife and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw has lasted the rest of my life you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose that your eye was as,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
372,the grass merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter one side of what the other side of what thought to herself of the mushroom said the just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand and now which is which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the righthand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
373,her but those serpents theres no pleasing them was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the had finished as if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the but i must be on the lookout for serpents night and day why i havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks im very sorry youve been annoyed said who was beginning to see its meaning and just as id taken the highest tree in the wood continued the raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ugh serpent but im not a serpent i tell you said aim a well what are you said the pigeon i can see youre trying to invent something iim a little girl said,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
374,done now how puzzling all these changes are im never sure what im going to be from one minute to another however ive got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beautiful gardenhow is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high whoever lives there thought itll never do to come upon them this size why i should frighten them out of their wits so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high chapter and pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the woodshe considered him,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
375,all the time he was speaking and this thought decidedly uncivil but perhaps he cant help it she said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head but at any rate he might answer questionshow am i to get in she repeated aloud i shall sit here the remarked till tomorrow at this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skimming out straight at the footmans head it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him or next day maybe the continued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happened how am i to get in asked again in a louder tone are you to get in at all said the footman thats the first question you know it was no doubt only did not like to be told so its,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
376,your cat grins like that its a cat said the and thats why pig she said the last word with such sudden violence that quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again i didnt know that cats always grinned in fact i didnt know that cats could grin they all can said the duchess and most of em do i dont know of any that do said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation you dont know much said the and thats a fact did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation while she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
377,baby at her as she spoke i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room the cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went out but it just missed her caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queershaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions just like a starfish thought alice the poor little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
378,sure to kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be murder to leave it behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time dont grunt said thats not at all a proper way of expressing yourself the baby grunted again and looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it there could be no doubt that it had a very turnup nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether did not like the look of the thing at all but perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears no there were no tears if youre going to turn into a pig my dear said seriously,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
379,felt that it ought to be treated with respect she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider come its pleased so far thought and she went on would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here that depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the cat i dont much care where said then it doesnt matter which way you go said the cat so long as i get somewhere added as an explanation oh youre sure to do that said the cat if you only walk long enough felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question what sort of people live about here in that direction the cat said waving its right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
380,half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the hare was said to live ive seen hatters before she said to herself the will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is it wont be raving madat least not so mad as it was in as she said this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on a branch of a tree did you say pig or fig said the cat i said pig replied and i wish you wouldnt keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy all right said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone well ive often,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
381,wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a raven like a writingdesk come we shall have some fun now thought glad theyve begun asking riddlesi believe i can guess that she added aloud do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the hare exactly so said alice then you should say what you mean the hare went on i do hastily replied at leastat least i mean what i saythats the same thing you know not the same thing a bit said the hatter you might just as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see you might just as well say added the that i like what i get is the same thing as i get what i like you might just as well say added the dormouse who,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
382,what i was going to remark myself have you guessed the riddle yet the said turning to again no i give it up replied whats the answer i havent the slightest idea said the hatter nor i said the march sighed wearily i think you might do something better with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers if you knew time as well as i do said the hatter you wouldnt talk about wasting it its him i dont know what you mean said of course you dont the said tossing his head contemptuously i dare say you never even spoke to not cautiously replied but i know i have to beat time when i learn music ah that accounts for it said the hatter he wont stand beating now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost anything you,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
383,morning just time to begin lessons youd only have to whisper a hint to and round goes the clock in a twinkling halfpast one time for dinner i only wish it was the march said to itself in a whisper that would be grand certainly said thoughtfully but theni shouldnt be hungry for it you know not at first perhaps said the hatter but you could keep it to halfpast one as long as you liked is that the way you manage asked the hatter shook his head mournfully not i he replied we quarrelled last marchjust before he went mad you know pointing with his tea spoon at the it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing twinkle twinkle little bat how i wonder what youre at you know the song perhaps ive heard something like it said alice it goes,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
384,dormouse shall they both cried wake up dormouse and they pinched it on both sides at once the dormouse slowly opened his eyes i wasnt asleep he said in a hoarse feeble voice i heard every word you fellows were saying tell us a story said the hare yes please do pleaded alice and be quick about it added the hatter or youll be asleep again before its done once upon a time there were three little sisters the dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were and and they lived at the bottom of a well what did they live on said who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking they lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking a minute or two they couldnt have done that you know gently remarked theyd have been ill so they were said the dormouse very ill,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
385,fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on but why did they live at the bottom of a well take some more tea the march said to very earnestly ive had nothing yet replied in an offended tone so i cant take more you mean you cant take less said the hatter its very easy to take more than nothing nobody asked your opinion said making personal remarks now the asked triumphantly did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and breadandbutter and then turned to the dormouse and repeated her question why did they live at the bottom of a well the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said it was a treaclewell theres no such thing was beginning very,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
386,last remark of course they were said the dormouse well in this answer so confused poor that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it they were learning to draw the dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of thingseverything that begins with an m why with an m said not said the march was silent had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on that begins with an m such as mousetraps and the moon and memory and muchnessyou know you say things are much of a muchnessdid you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness really now you ask me said very much confused i dont,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
387,at any rate ill never go there again said as she picked her way through the wood its the stupidest teaparty i ever was at in all my life just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it thats very curious she thought but everythings curious today i think i may as well go in at once and in she went once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table now ill manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and thenshe found herself,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
388,thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say look out now five dont go splashing paint over me like that i couldnt help it said five in a sulky tone seven jogged my elbow on which seven looked up and said thats right five always lay the blame on others youd better not talk said five i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded what for said the one who had spoken first thats none of your business two said seven yes it is his business said five and ill tell himit was for bringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions seven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon as she stood watching them,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
389,they were all ornamented with hearts next came the guests mostly and and among them recognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her then followed the knave of hearts carrying the crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king and queen of hearts was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see it so she stood still where she was and waited when the procession came opposite to they all stopped and looked at her and the said,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
390,i neednt be afraid of them and who are these said the queen pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children how should i know said surprised at her own courage its no business of turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed off with her head said very loudly and decidedly and the queen was silent the laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said consider my dear she is only a child the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them over the knave did so very carefully,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
391,had never seen such a curious croquetground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches the chief difficulty found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
392,to herself its the cat now i shall have somebody to talk to how are you getting on said the cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded its no use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at least one of them in another minute the whole head appeared and then put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared i dont think they play at all fairly began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
393,the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small off with his head she said without even looking round ill fetch the executioner myself said the eagerly and he hurried off thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the voice in the distance screaming with passion she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not so she went in search of her hedgehog the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
394,alices and they walked off together was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen when im a she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though i wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all soup does very well withoutmaybe its always pepper that makes people hottempered she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sourand camomile that makes them bitterandand barleysugar and such things that make children sweettempered i only wish people knew that then they wouldnt be so stingy about it you know she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear youre thinking,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
395,thing said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alices shoulder as she added and the moral of that istake care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves how fond she is of finding morals in things thought to herself i dare say youre wondering why i dont put my arm round your waist the said after a pause the reason is that im doubtful about the temper of your flamingo shall i try the experiment he might bite cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried very true said the flamingoes and mustard both bite and the moral of that isbirds of a feather flock together only mustard isnt a bird remarked right as usual said the what a clear way you have of putting things its a mineral i think said of course it is said the duchess who seemed,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
396,a thunderstorm a fine day your majesty the duchess began in a low weak voice now i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time take your choice the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment lets go on with the game the said to and was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquetground the other guests had taken advantage of the absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that a moments delay would cost them their lives all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his head or off with,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
397,all pardoned come thats a good thing she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered they very soon came upon a lying fast asleep in the sun if you dont know what a is look at the picture up lazy thing said the queen and take this young lady to see the mock turtle and to hear his history i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered and she walked off leaving alone with the did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen so she waited the sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled what fun said the half,LewisCarroll,male,victorian
