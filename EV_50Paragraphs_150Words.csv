1,that he ran away as he were wood demented for fear of the horrible strokes and sir after him with all his might and smote him on the shoulder and clave him to the middle then sir went into the hall and there came afore him three score ladies and damsels and all kneeled unto him and thanked god and him of their deliverance for sir said they the most part of us have been here this seven year their prisoners and we have worked all manner of silk works for our meat and we are all great gentlewomen born and blessed be the time knight that ever thou wert born for thou hast done the most worship that ever did knight in the world that will we bear record and we all pray you to tell us your name that we may tell our friends who delivered us out of,MarkTwain,,
2,had ye not been therefore to yield us unto him it were no reason well as to that said sir advise you well for ye may choose whether ye will die or live for an ye be yielden it shall be unto sir knight then they said in saving our lives we will do as thou commandest us then shall ye said sir on next coming go unto the court of king and there shall ye yield you unto and put you all three in her grace and mercy and say that sir sent you thither to be her prisoners on the morn sir arose early and left sir sleeping and sir took sir armor and his shield and armed him and so he went to the stable and took his horse and took his leave of his host and so he departed then soon after arose sir and missed sir,MarkTwain,,
3,the advantage so i judged it best to humor him we fixed up an agreement whereby i was to go with him and he was not to hurt me i came down and we started away i walking by the side of his horse we marched comfortably along through glades and over brooks which i could not remember to have seen beforewhich puzzled me and made me wonderand yet we did not come to any circus or sign of a circus so i gave up the idea of a circus and concluded he was from an asylum but we never came to an asylumso i was up a stump as you may say i asked him how far we were from he said he had never heard of the place which i took to be a lie but allowed it to go at that at the end of an hour we,MarkTwain,,
4,girls were always naked but nobody seemed to know it all of these people stared at me talked about me ran into the huts and fetched out their families to gape at me but nobody ever noticed that other fellow except to make him humble salutation and get no response for their pains in the town were some substantial windowless houses of stone scattered among a wilderness of thatched cabins the streets were mere crooked alleys and unpaved troops of dogs and nude children played in the sun and made life and noise hogs roamed and rooted contentedly about and one of them lay in a reeking wallow in the middle of the main thoroughfare and suckled her family presently there was a distant blare of military music it came nearer still nearer and soon a noble cavalcade wound into view glorious with plumed helmets and flashing mail and flaunting banners,MarkTwain,,
5,boyish fashion as we walked along and made himself old friends with me at once asked me all sorts of questions about myself and about my clothes but never waited for an answeralways chattered straight ahead as if he didnt know he had asked a question and wasnt expecting any reply until at last he happened to mention that he was born in the beginning of the year 513 it made the cold chills creep over me i stopped and said a little faintly maybe i didnt hear you just right say it againand say it slow what year was it 513 513 you dont look it come my boy i am a stranger and friendless be honest and honorable with me are you in your right mind he said he was are these other people in their right minds he said they were and this isnt an asylum i mean,MarkTwain,,
6,all right i didnt want any softer thing i would boss the whole country inside of three months for i judged i would have the start of the besteducated man in the kingdom by a matter of thirteen hundred years and upward im not a man to waste time after my minds made up and theres work on hand so i said to the page now clarence my boyif that might happen to be your name ill get you to post me up a little if you dont mind what is the name of that apparition that brought me here my master and thine that is the good knight and great lord sir the seneschal foster brother to our liege the king very good go on tell me everything he made a long story of it but the part that had immediate interest for me was this he said i was,MarkTwain,,
7,interesting it was an immense place and rather nakedyes and full of loud contrasts it was very very lofty so lofty that the banners depending from the arched beams and girders away up there floated in a sort of twilight there was a stonerailed gallery at each end high up with musicians in the one and women clothed in stunning colors in the other the floor was of big stone flags laid in black and white squares rather battered by age and use and needing repair as to ornament there wasnt any strictly speaking though on the walls hung some huge tapestries which were probably taxed as works of art battlepieces they were with horses shaped like those which children cut out of paper or create in gingerbread with men on them in scale armor whose scales are represented by round holesso that the mans coat looks as if it had,MarkTwain,,
8,innocent lot telling lies of the stateliest pattern with a most gentle and winning naivety and ready and willing to listen to anybody elses lie and believe it too it was hard to associate them with anything cruel or dreadful and yet they dealt in tales of blood and suffering with a guileless relish that made me almost forget to shudder i was not the only prisoner present there were twenty or more poor devils many of them were maimed hacked carved in a frightful way and their hair their faces their clothing were caked with black and stiffened drenchings of blood they were suffering sharp physical pain of course and weariness and hunger and thirst no doubt and at least none had given them the comfort of a wash or even the poor charity of a lotion for their wounds yet you never heard them utter a moan or a,MarkTwain,,
9,captured and their friends and backers killed and stripped of their steeds and armor as a general thingas far as i could make outthese murderous adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings out no as a rule they were simply duels between strangersduels between people who had never even been introduced to each other and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever many a time i had seen a couple of boys strangers meet by chance and say simultaneously i can lick you and go at it on the spot but i had always imagined until now that that sort of thing belonged to children only and was a sign and mark of childhood but here were these big boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond yet there was something very engaging,MarkTwain,,
10,her good pleasure might elect and this as he said he was doing by command of sir the seneschal whose prisoners they were he having vanquished them by his single might and prowess in sturdy conflict in the field surprise and astonishment flashed from face to face all over the house the queens gratified smile faded out at the name of sir and she looked disappointed and the page whispered in my ear with an accent and manner expressive of extravagant derision sir forsooth oh call me pet names dearest call me a marine in twice a thousand years shall the unholy invention of man labor at odds to beget the fellow to this majestic lie every eye was fastened with severe inquiry upon sir he was equal to the occasion he got up and played his hand like a majorand took every trick he said he would state the case,MarkTwain,,
11,of sir and as for me i was perfectly amazed that one man all by himself should have been able to beat down and capture such battalions of practiced fighters i said as much to but this mocking featherhead only said an sir had had time to get another skin of sour wine into him ye had seen the accompt doubled i looked at the boy in sorrow and as i looked i saw the cloud of a deep despondency settle upon his countenance i followed the direction of his eye and saw that a very old and whitebearded man clothed in a flowing black gown had risen and was standing at the table upon unsteady legs and feebly swaying his ancient head and surveying the company with his watery and wandering eye the same suffering look that was in the pages face was observable in all the faces aroundthe look,MarkTwain,,
12,said hereby is a sword that shall be yours and i may so they rode till they came to a lake the which was a fair water and broad and in the midst of the lake was ware of an arm clothed in white samite that held a fair sword in that hand lo said yonder is that sword that i spake of with that they saw a damsel going upon the lake what damsel is that said is the lady of the lake said and within that lake is a rock and therein is as fair a place as any on earth and richly beseen and this damsel will come to you anon and then speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword anon withal came the damsel unto and saluted him and he her again said what sword is that that yonder the arm holdeth,MarkTwain,,
13,never lose no blood be ye never so sore wounded therefore keep well the scabbard always with you so they rode into and by the way they met with sir but had done such a craft that saw not and he passed by without any words i marvel said that the knight would not speak sir said he saw you not for and he had seen you ye had not lightly departed so they came unto whereof his knights were passing glad and when they heard of his adventures they marveled that he would jeopard his person so alone but all men of worship said it was merry to be under such a chieftain that would put his person in adventure as other poor knights did chapter iv sir dinadan the humorist it seemed to me that this quaint lie was most simply and beautifully told but then i had heard,MarkTwain,,
14,before i was born and listen again to poor flat wormeaten jokes that had given me the dry gripes when i was a boy thirteen hundred years afterwards it about convinced me that there isnt any such thing as a new joke possible everybody laughed at these antiquities but then they always do i had noticed that centuries later however of course the scoffer didnt laughi mean the boy no he scoffed there wasnt anything he wouldnt scoff at he said the most of sir dinadans jokes were rotten and the rest were petrified i said petrified was good as i believed myself that the only right way to classify the majestic ages of some of those jokes was by geologic periods but that neat idea hit the boy in a blank place for geology hadnt been invented yet however i made a note of the remark and calculated to educate,MarkTwain,,
15,century broadly speaking the earliest samples of the real lady and real gentleman discoverable in english historyor in european history for that mattermay be said to have made their appearance suppose sir instead of putting the conversations into the mouths of his characters had allowed the characters to speak for themselves we should have had talk from and ivanhoe and the soft lady which would embarrass a tramp in our day however to the unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate people were not aware that they were indecent and i had presence of mind enough not to mention it they were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were mightily relieved at last when old merlin swept the difficulty away for them with a commonsense hint he asked them why they were so dullwhy didnt it occur to them to strip me in half a minute i was as naked,MarkTwain,,
16,serious dream or no dream for i knew by past experience of the lifelike intensity of dreams that to be burned to death even in a dream would be very far from being a jest and was a thing to be avoided by any means fair or foul that i could contrive so i said beseechingly ah good boy only friend ive gotfor you are my friend arent youdont fail me help me to devise some way of escaping from this place now do but hear thyself escape why man the corridors are in guard and keep of menatarms no doubt no doubt but how many clarence not many i hope full a score one may not hope to escape after a pause hesitatingly and there be other reasonsand weightier other ones what are they well they sayoh but i darent indeed darent why poor lad what is the matter why,MarkTwain,,
17,at that and i want him to be made to understand that i am just quietly arranging a little calamity here that will make the fur fly in these realms if sir project is carried out and any harm comes to me will you get that to the king for me the poor boy was in such a state that he could hardly answer me it was pitiful to see a creature so terrified so unnerved so demoralized but he promised everything and on my side he made me promise over and over again that i would remain his friend and never turn against him or cast any enchantments upon him then he worked his way out staying himself with his hand along the wall like a sick person presently this thought occurred to me how heedless i have been when the boy gets calm he will wonder why a great,MarkTwain,,
18,sample suppose i should be asked to name my calamity yes i had made a blunder i ought to have invented my calamity first what shall i do what can i say to gain a little time i was in trouble again in the deepest kind of trouble theres a footsteptheyre coming if i had only just a moment to think good ive got it im all right you see it was the eclipse it came into my mind in the nick of time how or cortez or one of those people played an eclipse as a saving trump once on some savages and i saw my chance i could play it myself now and it wouldnt be any plagiarism either because i should get it in nearly a thousand years ahead of those parties came in subdued distressed and said i hasted the message to our liege the king and,MarkTwain,,
19,way it would be the making of me i knew that there was one thing which had got pushed into the background of my mind that was the halfconviction that when the nature of my proposed calamity should be reported to those superstitious people it would have such an effect that they would want to compromise so by and by when i heard footsteps coming that thought was recalled to me and i said to myself as sure as anything its the compromise well if it is good all right i will accept but if it isnt i mean to stand my ground and play my hand for all it is worth the door opened and some menatarms appeared the leader said the stake is ready come the stake the strength went out of me and i almost fell down it is hard to get ones breath at such a time,MarkTwain,,
20,the littlest little darkness mind and cease with that it will be sufficient they will see that i spoke falselybeing ignorant as they will fancy and with the falling of the first shadow of that darkness you shall see them go mad with fear and they will set you free and make you great go to thy triumph now but rememberah good friend i implore thee remember my supplication and do the blessed sun no hurt for my sake thy true friend i choked out some words through my grief and misery as much as to say i would spare the sun for which the lads eyes paid me back with such deep and loving gratitude that i had not the heart to tell him his goodhearted foolishness had ruined me and sent me to my death as the soldiers assisted me across the court the stillness was so profound that,MarkTwain,,
21,i knew i was master of the situation now the king said be merciful fair sir and essay no further in this perilous matter lest disaster follow it was reported to us that your powers could not attain unto their full strength until the morrow but your majesty thinks the report may have been a lie it was a lie that made an immense effect up went appealing hands everywhere and the king was assailed with a storm of supplications that i might be bought off at any price and the calamity stayed the king was eager to comply he said name any terms reverend sir even to the halving of my kingdom but banish this calamity spare the sun my fortune was made i would have taken him up in a minute but i couldnt stop an eclipse the thing was out of the question so i asked time to,MarkTwain,,
22,a puzzled condition anyway and wanted to think something was wrong about that eclipse and the fact was very unsettling if this wasnt the one i was after how was i to tell whether this was the or nothing but a dream dear me if i could only prove it was the latter here was a glad new hope if the boy was right about the date and this was surely the 20th it wasnt the sixth century i reached for the monks sleeve in considerable excitement and asked him what day of the month it was hang him he said it was the twentyfirst it made me turn cold to hear him i begged him not to make any mistake about it but he was sure he knew it was the 21st so that featherheaded boy had botched things again the time of the day was right for the eclipse,MarkTwain,,
23,and more distressed i now said i have reflected sir king for a lesson i will let this darkness proceed and spread night in the world but whether i blot out the sun for good or restore it shall rest with you these are the terms to wit you shall remain king over all your dominions and receive all the glories and honors that belong to the kingship but you shall appoint me your perpetual minister and executive and give me for my services one per cent of such actual increase of revenue over and above its present amount as i may succeed in creating for the state if i cant live on that i shant ask anybody to give me a lift is it satisfactory there was a prodigious roar of applause and out of the midst of it the kings voice rose saying away with his bonds and set,MarkTwain,,
24,given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle after the kings they were aglow with loudcolored silken hangings but the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet and they were misfit rushes at that being not all of one breed as for conveniences properly speaking there werent any i mean little conveniences it is the little conveniences that make the real comfort of life the big oaken chairs graced with rude carvings were well enough but that was the stopping place there was no soap no matches no lookingglassexcept a metal one about as powerful as a pail of water and not a chromo i had been used to chromos for years and i saw now that without my suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the fabric of my being and was become a part of me it made me homesick to,MarkTwain,,
25,always admired to study rs art it was so fresh and unconventional there wasnt even a bell or a speakingtube in the castle i had a great many servants and those that were on duty lolled in the anteroom and when i wanted one of them i had to go and call for him there was no gas there were no candles a bronze dish half full of boardinghouse butter with a blazing rag floating in it was the thing that produced what was regarded as light a lot of these hung along the walls and modified the dark just toned it down enough to make it dismal if you went out at night your servants carried torches there were no books pens paper or ink and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows it is a little thingglass isuntil it is absent then it becomes a big,MarkTwain,,
26,as to time and trouble but of course it was at the same time compensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center of homage it turned brer merlin green with envy and spite which was a great satisfaction to me but there was one thing i couldnt understandnobody had asked for an autograph i spoke to clarence about it by i had to explain to him what it was then he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen priests land think of that there was another thing that troubled me a little those multitudes presently began to agitate for another miracle that was natural to be able to carry back to their far homes the boast that they had seen the man who could command the sun riding in the heavens and be obeyed would make them great in the eyes of their,MarkTwain,,
27,but to be able to also say they had seen him work a miracle themselveswhy people would come a distance to see them the pressure got to be pretty strong there was going to be an eclipse of the moon and i knew the date and hour but it was too far away two years i would have given a good deal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was a big market for it it seemed a great pity to have it wasted so and come lagging along at a time when a body wouldnt have any use for it as like as not if it had been booked for only a month away i could have sold it short but as matters stood i couldnt seem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good so i gave up trying next,MarkTwain,,
28,with these charges when the thirteenth night was come we put up our lightningrod bedded it in one of the batches of powder and ran wires from it to the other batches everybody had shunned that locality from the day of my proclamation but on the morning of the fourteenth i thought best to warn the people through the heralds to keep clear awaya quarter of a mile away then added by command that at some time during the twentyfour hours i would consummate the miracle but would first give a brief notice by flags on the castle towers if in the daytime by torchbaskets in the same places if at night thundershowers had been tolerably frequent of late and i was not much afraid of a failure still i shouldnt have cared for a delay of a day or two i should have explained that i was busy with affairs,MarkTwain,,
29,small matters like that and i would give him a lift now and then when his poor little parlormagic soured on him there wasnt a rag of his tower left but i had the government rebuild it for him and advised him to take boarders but he was too hightoned for that and as for being grateful he never even said thank you he was a rather hard lot take him how you might but then you couldnt fairly expect a man to be sweet that had been set back so chapter viii the boss to be vested with enormous authority is a fine thing but to have the onlooking world consent to it is a finer the tower episode solidified my power and made it impregnable if any were perchance disposed to be jealous and critical before that they experienced a change of heart now there was not any one,MarkTwain,,
30,in the procession was my fullsized fellow visible i was a unique and glad to know that that fact could not be dislodged or challenged for thirteen centuries and a half for sure yes in power i was equal to the king at the same time there was another power that was a trifle stronger than both of us put together that was the church i do not wish to disguise that fact i couldnt if i wanted to but never mind about that now it will show up in its proper place later on it didnt cause me any trouble in the beginning at least any of consequence well it was a curious country and full of interest and the people they were the quaintest and simplest and trustingest race why they were nothing but rabbits it was pitiful for a person born in a wholesome free atmosphere to listen,MarkTwain,,
31,you probably never find it out for yourself and dont believe it when somebody else tells you it is enough to make a body ashamed of his race to think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones without shadow of right or reason and the seventhrate people that have always figured as its aristocraciesa company of monarchs and nobles who as a rule would have achieved only poverty and obscurity if left like their betters to their own exertions the most of king arthurs british nation were slaves pure and simple and bore that name and wore the iron collar on their necks and the rest were slaves in fact but without the name they imagined themselves men and freemen and called themselves so the truth was the nation as a body was in the world for one object and one only to grovel before king and,MarkTwain,,
32,the very slaves and tramps i was just that kind of an elephant and nothing more i was admired also feared but it was as an animal is admired and feared the animal is not reverenced neither was i i was not even respected i had no pedigree no inherited title so in the kings and nobles eyes i was mere dirt the people regarded me with wonder and awe but there was no reverence mixed with it through the force of inherited ideas they were not able to conceive of anything being entitled to that except pedigree and lordship there you see the hand of that awful power the roman catholic church in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms before the day of the churchs supremacy in the world men were men and held their heads up and had,MarkTwain,,
33,have been fair anyway because as far back as i could go our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister i couldnt have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proud and setup over any title except one that should come from the nation itself the only legitimate source and such an one i hoped to win and in the course of years of honest and honorable endeavor i did win it and did wear it with a high and clean pride this title fell casually from the lips of a blacksmith one day in a village was caught up as a happy thought and tossed from mouth to mouth with a laugh and an affirmative vote in ten days it had swept the kingdom and was become as familiar as the kings name i was never known by any other designation afterward whether in the nations talk or in,MarkTwain,,
34,i was generally on handfor two reasons a man must not hold himself aloof from the things which his friends and his community have at heart if he would be likedespecially as a statesman and both as business man and statesman i wanted to study the tournament and see if i couldnt invent an improvement on it that reminds me to remark in passing that the very first official thing i did in my administrationand it was on the very first day of it toowas to start a patent office for i knew that a country without a patent office and good patent laws was just a crab and couldnt travel any way but sideways or backways things ran along a tournament nearly every week and now and then the boys used to want me to take a handi mean sir and the restbut i said i would by and by,MarkTwain,,
35,didnt mind it in the present circumstances because it kept me from hearing the quacks detaching legs and arms from the days cripples they ruined an uncommon good old crosscut saw for me and broke the sawbuck too but i let it pass and as for my axewell i made up my mind that the next time i lent an axe to a surgeon i would pick my century i not only watched this tournament from day to day but detailed an intelligent priest from my and ordered him to report it for it was my purpose by and by when i should have gotten the people along far enough to start a newspaper the first thing you want in a new country is a patent office then work up your school system and after that out with your paper a newspaper has its faults and plenty of them but no,MarkTwain,,
36,isles and knights of the castle encountered with sir and sir tor and sir tor smote down sir to the earth then came sir carados of the dolorous tower and sir turquine knights of the castle and there encountered with them sir and sir that were two brethren and there encountered sir with sir and either brake their spears unto their hands and then sir turquine with sir and either of them smote down other horse and all to the earth and either parties rescued other and horsed them again and sir and sir knights of the castle encountered with sir brandiles and sir and these four knights encountered mightily and brake their spears to their hands then came sir pertolope from the castle and there encountered with him sir and there sir pertolope the green knight smote down sir lionel brother to sir launcelot all this was marked by noble,MarkTwain,,
37,deep and real kindness for him too for the reason that if by malice of fate he knew the one particular anecdote which i had heard oftenest and had most hated and most loathed all my life he had at least spared it me it was one which i had heard attributed to every humorous person who had ever stood on american soil from down to it was about a humorous lecturer who flooded an ignorant audience with the killingest jokes for an hour and never got a laugh and then when he was leaving some gray simpletons wrung him gratefully by the hand and said it had been the funniest thing they had ever heard and it was all they could do to keep from laughin right out in meetin that anecdote never saw the day that it was worth the telling and yet i had sat under the telling,MarkTwain,,
38,i unconsciously out with the prayer i hope to gracious hes killed but by illluck before i had got half through with the words sir crashed into sir sagramor le desirous and sent him thundering over his horses crupper and sir sagramor caught my remark and thought i meant it for him well whenever one of those people got a thing into his head there was no getting it out again i knew that so i saved my breath and offered no explanations as soon as sir sagramor got well he notified me that there was a little account to settle between us and he named a day three or four years in the future place of settlement the lists where the offense had been given i said i would be ready when he got back you see he was going for the holy grail the boys all took a flier,MarkTwain,,
39,then when it by and by gets into selfish hands as it is always bound to do it means death to human liberty and paralysis to human thought all mines were royal property and there were a good many of them they had formerly been worked as savages always work minesholes grubbed in the earth and the mineral brought up in sacks of hide by hand at the rate of a ton a day but i had begun to put the mining on a scientific basis as early as i could yes i had made pretty handsome progress when sir sagramors challenge struck me four years rolled byand then well you would never imagine it in the world unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in safe hands the despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect government an earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect earthly government if,MarkTwain,,
40,resources of a kingdom at his command unsuspected by this dark land i had the civilization of the nineteenth century booming under its very nose it was fenced away from the public view but there it was a gigantic and unassailable factand to be heard from yet if i lived and had luck there it was as sure a fact and as substantial a fact as any serene volcano standing innocent with its smokeless summit in the blue sky and giving no sign of the rising hell in its bowels my schools and churches were children four years before they were grownup now my shops of that day were vast factories now where i had a dozen trained men then i had a thousand now where i had one brilliant expert then i had fifty now i stood with my hand on the cock so to speak ready to turn it,MarkTwain,,
41,a little at this and that and the other superstition and so prepare the way gradually for a better order of things i was turning on my light onecandlepower at a time and meant to continue to do so i had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom and they were doing very well i meant to work this racket more and more as time wore on if nothing occurred to frighten me one of my deepest secrets was my west pointmy military academy i kept that most jealously out of sight and i did the same with my naval academy which i had established at a remote seaport both were prospering to my satisfaction was twentytwo now and was my head executive my right hand he was a darling he was equal to anything there wasnt anything he couldnt turn his hand to of late i had been training,MarkTwain,,
42,be to ask for credentialsyes and a pointer or two as to locality of castle best route to it and so on but nobody ever thought of so simple and commonsense a thing at that no everybody swallowed these peoples lies whole and never asked a question of any sort or about anything well one day when i was not around one of these people came alongit was a she one this timeand told a tale of the usual pattern her mistress was a captive in a vast and gloomy castle along with fortyfour other young and beautiful girls pretty much all of them princesses they had been languishing in that cruel captivity for twentysix years the masters of the castle were three stupendous brothers each with four arms and one eyethe eye in the center of the forehead and as big as a fruit sort of fruit not mentioned their,MarkTwain,,

44,was a case for dynamite why she was a perfect ass and yet the king and his knights had listened to her as if she had been a leaf out of the gospel it kind of sizes up the whole party and think of the simple ways of this court this wandering wench hadnt any more trouble to get access to the king in his palace than she would have had to get into the poorhouse in my day and country in fact he was glad to see her glad to hear her tale with that adventure of hers to offer she was as welcome as a corpse is to a coroner just as i was endingup these reflections came back i remarked upon the barren result of my efforts with the girl hadnt got hold of a single point that could help me to find the castle the youth looked,MarkTwain,,

250,these sounds as signs of ideas besides articulate sounds therefore it was further necessary that he should be able to use these sounds as signs of internal conceptions and to make them stand as marks for the ideas within his own mind whereby they might be made known to others and the thoughts of mens minds be conveyed from one to another 3 to make them general signs but neither was this sufficient to make words so useful as they ought to be it is not enough for the perfection of language that sounds can be made signs of ideas unless those signs can be so made use of as to comprehend several particular things for the multiplication of words would have perplexed their use had every particular thing need of a distinct name to be signified by to remedy this inconvenience language had yet a further improvement in the use,JohnLocke,,
251,to what it is that names in the use of language are immediately applied secondly since all except proper names are general and so stand not particularly for this or that single thing but for sorts and ranks of things it will be necessary to consider in the next place what the sorts and kinds or if you rather like the latin names what the species and genera of things are wherein they consist and how they come to be made these being as they ought well looked into we shall the better come to find the right use of words the natural advantages and defects of language and the remedies that ought to be used to avoid the inconveniences of obscurity or uncertainty in the signification of words without which it is impossible to discourse with any clearness or order concerning knowledge which being conversant about propositions and those most,JohnLocke,,

253,idea of a shining yellow and a very weighty substance another adds to those qualities fusibility and then the word gold signifies to him a body bright yellow fusible and very heavy another adds malleability each of these uses equally the word gold when they have occasion to express the idea which they have applied it to but it is evident that each can apply it only to his own idea nor can he make it stand as a sign of such a complex idea as he has not 4 words are often secretly referred first to the ideas supposed to be in other mens minds but though words as they are used by men can properly and immediately signify nothing but the ideas that are in the mind of the speaker yet they in their thoughts give them a secret reference to two other things first they suppose their words,JohnLocke,,
254,signification and why secondly that though the proper and immediate signification of words are ideas in the mind of the speaker yet because by familiar use from our cradles we come to learn certain articulate sounds very perfectly and have them readily on our tongues and always at hand in our memories but yet are not always careful to examine or settle their significations perfectly it often happens that men even when they would apply themselves to an attentive consideration do set their thoughts more on words than things nay because words are many of them learned before the ideas are known for which they stand therefore some not only children but men speak several words no otherwise than parrots do only because they have learned them and have been accustomed to those sounds but so far as words are of use and signification so far is there a constant connexion,JohnLocke,,
255,certain their signification in his use of them is limited to his ideas and they can be signs of nothing else chapter iii of general terms 1 the greatest part of words are general terms all things that exist being particulars it may perhaps be thought reasonable that words which ought to be conformed to things should be so tooi mean in their signification but yet we find quite the contrary the far greatest part of words that make all languages are general terms which has not been the effect of neglect or chance but of reason and necessity 2 that every particular thing should have a name for itself is impossible first it is impossible that every particular thing should have a distinct peculiar name for the signification and use of words depending on that connexion which the mind makes between its ideas and the sounds it uses as signs,JohnLocke,,
256,i speak it this cannot be done by names applied to particular things whereof i alone having the ideas in my mind the names of them could not be significant or intelligible to another who was not acquainted with all those very particular things which had fallen under my notice 4 a distinct name for every particular thing not fitted for enlargement of knowledge thirdly but yet granting this also feasible which i think is not yet a distinct name for every particular thing would not be of any great use for the improvement of knowledge which though founded in particular things enlarges itself by general views to which things reduced into sorts under general names are properly subservient these with the names belonging to them come within some compass and do not multiply every moment beyond what either the mind can contain or use requires and therefore in these men,JohnLocke,,
257,occasion to mention this or that particular horse when he is out of sight 6 how general words are made the next thing to be considered ishow general words come to be made for since all things that exist are only particulars how come we by general terms or where find we those general natures they are supposed to stand for words become general by being made the signs of general ideas and ideas become general by separating from them the circumstances of time and place and any other ideas that may determine them to this or that particular existence by this way of abstraction they are made capable of representing more individuals than one each of which having in it a conformity to that abstract idea is as we call it of that sort 7 shown by the way we enlarge our complex ideas from infancy but to deduce this,JohnLocke,,
258,make such a noise in the schools and are with justice so little regarded out of them is nothing else but abstract ideas more or less comprehensive with names annexed to them in all which this is constant and unvariable that every more general term stands for such an idea and is but a part of any of those contained under it 10 why the genus is ordinarily made use of in definitions this may show us the reason why in the defining of words which is nothing but declaring their signification we make use of the genus or next general word that comprehends it which is not out of necessity but only to save the labour of enumerating the several simple ideas which the next general word or genus stands for or perhaps sometimes the shame of not being able to do it but though defining by genus and differentia,JohnLocke,,
259,are the essences of genera and species the next thing therefore to be considered is what kind of signification it is that general words have for as it is evident that they do not signify barely one particular thing for then they would not be general terms but proper names so on the other side it is as evident they do not signify a plurality for man and men would then signify the same and the distinction of numbers as the grammarians call them would be superfluous and useless that then which general words signify is a sort of things and each of them does that by being a sign of an abstract idea in the mind to which idea as things existing are found to agree so they come to be ranked under that name or which is all one be of that sort whereby it is evident that the,JohnLocke,,
260,is one and the same from whence it is easy to observe that the essences of the sorts of things and consequently the sorting of things is the workmanship of the understanding that abstracts and makes those general ideas 13 they are the workmanship of the understanding but have their foundation in the similitude of things i would not here be thought to forget much less to deny that in the production of things makes several of them alike there is nothing more obvious especially in the races of animals and all things propagated by seed but yet i think we may say the sorting of them under names is the workmanship of the understanding taking occasion from the similitude it observes amongst them to make abstract general ideas and set them up in the mind with names annexed to them as patterns or forms for in that sense the word,JohnLocke,,
261,simple ideas which the understanding put together and then abstracting it affixed a name to it so that in truth every distinct abstract idea is a distinct essence and the names that stand for such distinct ideas are the names of things essentially different thus a circle is as essentially different from an oval as a sheep from a goat and rain is as essentially different from snow as water from earth that abstract idea which is the essence of one being impossible to be communicated to the other and thus any two abstract ideas that in any part vary one from another with two distinct names annexed to them constitute two distinct sorts or if you please species as essentially different as any two of the most remote or opposite in the world 15 several significations of the word essence but since the essences of things are thought by some,JohnLocke,,
262,species the other and more rational opinion is of those who look on all natural things to have a real but unknown constitution of their insensible parts from which flow those sensible qualities which serve us to distinguish them one from another according as we have occasion to rank them into sorts under common denominations the former of these opinions which supposes these essences as a certain number of forms or moulds wherein all natural things that exist are cast and do equally partake has i imagine very much perplexed the knowledge of natural things the frequent productions of monsters in all the species of animals and of changelings and other strange issues of human birth carry with them difficulties not possible to consist with this hypothesis since it is as impossible that two things partaking exactly of the same real essence should have different properties as that two figures partaking,JohnLocke,,
263,especially those things we are acquainted with and have ranked into bands under distinct names or ensigns thus that which was grass today is tomorrow the flesh of a sheep and within a few days after becomes part of a man in all which and the like changes it is evident their real essencei e that constitution whereon the properties of these several things dependedis destroyed and perishes with them but essences being taken for ideas established in the mind with names annexed to them they are supposed to remain steadily the same whatever mutations the particular substances are liable to for whatever becomes of alexander and bucephalus the ideas to which man and horse are annexed are supposed nevertheless to remain the same and so the essences of those species are preserved whole and undestroyed whatever changes happen to any or all of the individuals of those species by this,JohnLocke,,
264,the essence of a mermaid is as intelligible as that of a man and the idea of an unicorn as certain steady and permanent as that of a horse from what has been said it is evident that the doctrine of the immutability of essences proves them to be only abstract ideas and is founded on the relation established between them and certain sounds as signs of them and will always be true as long as the same name can have the same signification 20 recapitulation to conclude this is that which in short i would say viz that all the great business of genera and species and their essences amounts to no more but thisthat men making abstract ideas and settling them in their minds with names annexed to them do thereby enable themselves to consider things and discourse of them as it were in bundles for the easier and,JohnLocke,,
265,the names of simple ideas are not capable of any definition the names of all complex ideas are it has not that i know been yet observed by anybody what words are and what are not capable of being defined the want whereof is as i am apt to think not seldom the occasion of great wrangling and obscurity in mens discourses whilst some demand definitions of terms that cannot be defined and others think they ought not to rest satisfied in an explication made by a more general word and its restriction or to speak in terms of art by a genus and difference when even after such definition made according to rule those who hear it have often no more a clear conception of the meaning of the word than they had before this at least i think that the showing what words are and what are not capable,JohnLocke,,
266,a dutchman ordinarily had in his mind and would signify to another when he used that sound 9 modern definition of motion nor have the modern philosophers who have endeavoured to throw off the jargon of the schools and speak intelligibly much better succeeded in defining simple ideas whether by explaining their causes or any otherwise the atomists who define motion to be a passage from one place to another what do they more than put one synonymous word for another for what is passage other than motion and if they were asked what passage was how would they better define it than by motion for is it not at least as proper and significant to say passage is a motion from one place to another as to say motion is a passage c this is to translate and not to define when we change two words of the same signification,JohnLocke,,
267,light which it pretends to define at all understood by a blind man but the definition of motion appears not at first sight so useless because it escapes this way of trial for this simple idea entering by the touch as well as sight it is impossible to show an example of any one who has no other way to get the idea of motion but barely by the definition of that name those who tell us that light is a great number of little globules striking briskly on the bottom of the eye speak more intelligibly than the schools but yet these words never so well understood would make the idea the word light stands for no more known to a man that understands it not before than if one should tell him that light was nothing but a company of little tennisballs which fairies all day long struck with,JohnLocke,,
268,simple idea will he have who hopes to get it only from a definition or other words made use of to explain it 12 the contrary shown in complex ideas by instances of a statue and rainbow the case is quite otherwise in complex ideas which consisting of several simple ones it is in the power of words standing for the several ideas that make that composition to imprint complex ideas in the mind which were never there before and so make their names be understood in such collections of ideas passing under one name definition or the teaching the signification of one word by several others has place and may make us understand the names of things which never came within the reach of our senses and frame ideas suitable to those in other mens minds when they use those names provided that none of the terms of the definition,JohnLocke,,

270,has been shewed are nothing but the abstract ideas in the mind to which the name is annexed thus far the names and essences of mixed modes have nothing but what is common to them with other ideas but if we take a little nearer survey of them we shall find that they have something peculiar which perhaps may deserve our attention 2 first the abstract ideas they stand for are made by the understanding the first particularity i shall observe in them is that the abstract ideas or if you please the essences of the several species of mixed modes are made by the understanding wherein they differ from those of simple ideas in which sort the mind has no power to make any one but only receives such as are presented to it by the real existence of things operating upon it 3 secondly made arbitrarily and without patterns,JohnLocke,,
271,are the creatures of the understanding where they have a being as subservient to all the ends of real truth and knowledge as when they really exist and we cannot doubt but lawmakers have often made laws about species of actions which were only the creatures of their own understandings beings that had no other existence but in their own minds and i think nobody can deny but that the resurrection was a species of mixed modes in the mind before it really existed 6 instances murder incest stabbing to see how arbitrarily these essences of mixed modes are made by the mind we need but take a view of almost any of them a little looking into them will satisfy us that it is the mind that combines several scattered independent ideas into one complex one and by the common name it gives them makes them the essence of a,JohnLocke,,

292,several particular things to agree with others in several of those simple ideas we make that collection our specific idea and give it a general name that in recording our thoughts and in our discourse with others we may in one short word designate all the individuals that agree in that complex idea without enumerating the simple ideas that make it up and so not waste our time and breath in tedious descriptions which we see they are fain to do who would discourse of any new sort of things they have not yet a name for 31 essences of species under the same name very different in different minds but however these species of substances pass well enough in ordinary conversation it is plain that this complex idea wherein they observe several individuals to agree is by different men made very differently by some more and others less accurately in,JohnLocke,,

322,upon which the argument turns used sometimes for one collection of simple ideas and sometimes for another which is a perfect abuse of language words being intended for signs of my ideas to make them known to others not by any natural signification but by a voluntary imposition it is plain cheat and abuse when i make them stand sometimes for one thing and sometimes for another the wilful doing whereof can be imputed to nothing but great folly or greater dishonesty and a man in his accounts with another may with as much fairness make the characters of numbers stand sometimes for one and sometimes for another collection of units vg this character 3 stand sometimes for three sometimes for four and sometimes for eight as in his discourse or reasoning make the same words stand for different collections of simple ideas if men should do so in their reckonings,JohnLocke,,
323,extension of a body and yet there are those who find it necessary to confound their signification to this abuse and the mischiefs of confounding the signification of words logic and the liberal sciences as they have been handled in the schools have given reputation and the admired art of disputing hath added much to the natural imperfection of languages whilst it has been made use of and fitted to perplex the signification of words more than to discover the knowledge and truth of things and he that will look into that sort of learned writings will find the words there much more obscure uncertain and undetermined in their meaning than they are in ordinary conversation 7 logic and dispute have much contributed to this this is unavoidably to be so where mens parts and learning are estimated by their skill in disputing and if reputation and reward shall attend these,JohnLocke,,
324,calling it subtlety this though a very useless skill and that which i think the direct opposite to the ways of knowledge hath yet passed hitherto under the laudable and esteemed names of subtlety and acuteness and has had the applause of the schools and encouragement of one part of the learned men of the world and no wonder since the philosophers of old the disputing and wrangling philosophers i mean such as wittily and with reason taxes and the since aiming at glory and esteem for their great and universal knowledge easier a great deal to be pretended to than really acquired found this a good expedient to cover their ignorance with a curious and inexplicable web of perplexed words and procure to themselves the admiration of others by unintelligible terms the apter to produce wonder because they could not be understood whilst it appears in all history that these,JohnLocke,,
325,terms and holding them perpetually entangled in that endless labyrinth besides there is no such way to gain admittance or give defence to strange and absurd doctrines as to guard them round about with legions of obscure doubtful and undefined words which yet make these retreats more like the dens of robbers or holes of foxes than the fortresses of fair warriors which if it be hard to get them out of it is not for the strength that is in them but the briars and thorns and the obscurity of the thickets they are beset with for untruth being unacceptable to the mind of man there is no other defence left for absurdity but obscurity 10 but destroys the instruments of knowledge and communication thus learned ignorance and this art of keeping even inquisitive men from true knowledge hath been propagated in the world and hath much perplexed whilst it,JohnLocke,,
326,niceties but obscurity and uncertainty leaving the words more unintelligible and the reader more at a loss how else comes it to pass that princes speaking or writing to their servants in their ordinary commands are easily understood speaking to their people in their laws are not so and as i remarked before doth it not often happen that a man of an ordinary capacity very well understands a text or a law that he reads till he consults an expositor or goes to counsel who by that time he hath done explaining them makes the words signify either nothing at all or what he pleases 13 and ought not to pass for learning whether any byinterests of these professions have occasioned this i will not here examine but i leave it to be considered whether it would not be well for mankind whose concernment it is to know things as,JohnLocke,,
327,most important part of language and of all other the terms the most significant and should aerial and oetherial vehicles come once by the prevalency of that doctrine to be generally received anywhere no doubt those terms would make impressions on mens minds so as to establish them in the persuasion of the reality of such things as much as peripatetick forms and intentional species have heretofore done 15 instance in matter how much names taken for things are apt to mislead the understanding the attentive reading of philosophical writers would abundantly discover and that perhaps in words little suspected of any such misuse i shall instance in one only and that a very familiar one how many intricate disputes have there been about matter as if there were some such thing really in nature distinct from body as it is evident the word matter stands for an idea distinct from,JohnLocke,,
328,one body is bigger than another but it sounds harsh and i think is never used to say one matter is bigger than another whence comes this then from hence that though matter and body be not really distinct but wherever there is the one there is the other yet matter and body stand for two different conceptions whereof the one is incomplete and but a part of the other for body stands for a solid extended figured substance whereof matter is but a partial and more confused conception it seeming to me to be used for the substance and solidity of body without taking in its extension and figure and therefore it is that speaking of matter we speak of it always as one because in truth it expressly contains nothing but the idea of a solid substance which is everywhere the same everywhere uniform this being our idea of,JohnLocke,,
329,men would tell what ideas they make their words stand for there could not be half that obscurity or wrangling in the search or support of truth that there is 16 this makes errors lasting but whatever inconvenience follows from this mistake of words this i am sure that by constant and familiar use they charm men into notions far remote from the truth of things it would be a hard matter to persuade any one that the words which his father or schoolmaster the parson of the parish or such a reverend doctor used signified nothing that really existed in nature which perhaps is none of the least causes that men are so hardly drawn to quit their mistakes even in opinions purely philosophical and where they have no other interest but truth for the words they have a long time been used to remaining firm in their minds it,JohnLocke,,
330,them into propositions and affirm or deny anything about them we do most commonly tacitly suppose or intend they should stand for the real essence of a certain sort of substances for when a man says gold is malleable he means and would insinuate something more than this that what i call gold is malleable though truly it amounts to no more but would have this understood viz that gold ie what has the real essence of gold is malleable which amounts to thus much that malleableness depends on and is inseparable from the real essence of gold but a man not knowing wherein that real essence consists the connexion in his mind of malleableness is not truly with an essence he knows not but only with the sound gold he puts for it thus when we say that animal rationale is and animal imflume bipes latis unguibus is not a,JohnLocke,,
331,gold in name and about a parcel in the body itself vg a piece of leafgold laid before us though in discourse we are fain to substitute the name for the thing 20 the cause of this abuse a supposition of natures working always regularly in setting boundaries to species that which i think very much disposes men to substitute their names for the real essences of species is the supposition before mentioned that nature works regularly in the production of things and sets the boundaries to each of those species by giving exactly the same real internal constitution to each individual which we rank under one general name whereas any one who observes their different qualities can hardly doubt that many of the individuals called by the same name are in their internal constitution as different one from another as several of those which are ranked under different specific names,JohnLocke,,
332,sixthly there remains yet another more general though perhaps less observed abuse of words and that is that men having by a long and familiar use annexed to them certain ideas they are apt to imagine so near and necessary a connexion between the names and signification they use them in that they forwardly suppose one cannot but understand what their meaning is and therefore one ought to acquiesce in the words delivered as if it were past doubt that in the use of those common received sounds the speaker and hearer had necessarily the same precise ideas whence presuming that when they have in discourse used any term they have thereby as it were set before others the very thing they talked of and so likewise taking the words of others as naturally standing for just what they themselves have been accustomed to apply them to they never trouble themselves,JohnLocke,,
333,i know not what fault it can be to desire the explication of words whose sense seems dubious or why a man should be ashamed to own his ignorance in what sense another man uses his words since he has no other way of certainly knowing it but by being informed this abuse of taking words upon trust has nowhere spread so far nor with so ill effects as amongst men of letters the multiplication and obstinacy of disputes which have so laid waste the intellectual world is owing to nothing more than to this ill use of words for though it be generally believed that there is great diversity of opinions in the volumes and variety of controversies the world is distracted with yet the most i can find that the contending learned men of different parties do in their arguings one with another is that they speak different languages,JohnLocke,,
334,too when we use them as signs of real beings which yet never had any reality or existence 26 how mens words fail in all these first when used without any ideas first he that hath words of any language without distinct ideas in his mind to which he applies them does so far as he uses them in discourse only make a noise without any sense or signification and how learned soever he may seem by the use of hard words or learned terms is not much more advanced thereby in knowledge than he would be in learning who had nothing in his study but the bare titles of books without possessing the contents of them for all such words however put into discourse according to the right construction of grammatical rules or the harmony of wellturned periods do yet amount to nothing but bare sounds and nothing else 27,JohnLocke,,
335,his words loosely and unsteadily will either be not minded or not understood he that applies his names to ideas different from their common use wants propriety in his language and speaks gibberish and he that hath the ideas of substances disagreeing with the real existence of things so far wants the materials of true knowledge in his understanding and hath instead thereof chimeras 32 how mens words fail when they stand for substances in our notions concerning substances we are liable to all the former inconveniences v g he that uses the word tarantula without having any imagination or idea of what it stands for pronounces a good word but so long means nothing at all by it 2 he that in a newlydiscovered country shall see several sorts of animals and vegetables unknown to him before may have as true ideas of them as of a horse or a,JohnLocke,,
336,in great reputation and i doubt not but it will be thought great boldness if not brutality in me to have said thus much against it eloquence like the fair sex has too prevailing beauties in it to suffer itself ever to be spoken against and it is in vain to find fault with those arts of deceiving wherein men find pleasure to be deceived chapter xi of the remedies of the foregoing imperfections and abuses of words 1 remedies are worth seeking the natural and improved imperfections of languages we have seen above at large and speech being the great bond that holds society together and the common conduit whereby the improvements of knowledge are conveyed from one man and one generation to another it would well deserve our most serious thoughts to consider what remedies are to be found for the inconveniences above mentioned 2 are not easy to,JohnLocke,,
337,profession to teach or defend truth hath passed so much for a virtue a virtue indeed which consisting for the most part in nothing but the fallacious and illusory use of obscure or deceitful terms is only fit to make men more conceited in their ignorance and more obstinate in their errors 6 addicted to wrangling about sounds let us look into the books of controversy of any kind there we shall see that the effect of obscure unsteady or equivocal terms is nothing but noise and wrangling about sounds without convincing or bettering a mans understanding for if the idea be not agreed on betwixt the speaker and hearer for which the words stand the argument is not about things but names as often as such a word whose signification is not ascertained betwixt them comes in use their understandings have no other object wherein they agree but barely the,JohnLocke,,
338,judge it worth his while to think more maturely on this matter and oblige the world with his thoughts on it first remedy to use no word without an idea annexed to it first a man shall take care to use no word without a signification no name without an idea for which he makes it stand this rule will not seem altogether needless to any one who shall take the pains to recollect how often he has met with such words as instinct sympathy and antipathy c in the discourse of others so made use of as he might easily conclude that those that used them had no ideas in their minds to which they applied them but spoke them only as sounds which usually served instead of reasons on the like occasions not but that these words and the like have very proper significations in which they may be,JohnLocke,,
339,settled the idea of all its parts in his mind that he can do it when he pleases if any one who makes his complex idea of justice to be such a treatment of the person or goods of another as is according to law hath not a clear and distinct idea what law is which makes a part of his complex idea of justice it is plain his idea of justice itself will be confused and imperfect this exactness will perhaps be judged very troublesome and therefore most men will think they may be excused from settling the complex ideas of mixed modes so precisely in their minds but yet i must say till this be done it must not be wondered that they have a great deal of obscurity and confusion in their own minds and a great deal of wrangling in their discourse with others 10 and distinct,JohnLocke,,
340,to declare his meaning and make known what idea he makes it stand for this as has been shown cannot be done by definition and therefore when a synonymous word fails to do it there is but one of these ways left first sometimes the naming the subject wherein that simple idea is to be found will make its name to be understood by those who are acquainted with that subject and know it by that name so to make a countryman understand what feuillemorte colour signifies it may suffice to tell him it is the colour of withered leaves falling in autumn secondly but the only sure way of making known the signification of the name of any simple idea is by presenting to his senses that subject which may produce it in his mind and make him actually have the idea that word stands for 15 in mixed modes,JohnLocke,,
341,to say no worse of it to refuse to do it since a definition is the only way whereby the precise meaning of moral words can be known and yet a way whereby their meaning may be known certainly and without leaving any room for any contest about it and therefore the negligence or perverseness of mankind cannot be excused if their discourses in morality be not much more clear than those in natural philosophy since they are about ideas in the mind which are none of them false or disproportionate they having no external beings for the archetypes which they are referred to and must correspond with it is far easier for men to frame in their minds an idea which shall be the standard to which they will give the name justice with which pattern so made all actions that agree shall pass under that denomination than having seen,JohnLocke,,

343,eyes but yet by use have not got the precise nice idea of that peculiar yellow shall not perceive any difference the like may be said of those other simple ideas peculiar in their kind to any substance for which precise ideas there are no peculiar names the particular ringing sound there is in gold distinct from the sound of other bodies has no particular name annexed to it no more than the particular yellow that belongs to that metal 22 the ideas of the powers of substances are best known by definition but because many of the simple ideas that make up our specific ideas of substances are powers which lie not obvious to our senses in the things as they ordinarily appear therefore in the signification of our names of substances some part of the signification will be better made known by enumerating those simple ideas than by showing,JohnLocke,,
344,constitution of substances as we have of a triangle and so perceive how all their properties and operations flow from thence but the manner how they come by that knowledge exceeds our conceptions 24 ideas of substances must also be conformable to things fourthly but though definitions will serve to explain the names of substances as they stand for our ideas yet they leave them not without great imperfection as they stand for things for our names of substances being not put barely for our ideas but being made use of ultimately to represent things and so are put in their place their signification must agree with the truth of things as well as with mens ideas and therefore in substances we are not always to rest in the ordinary complex idea commonly received as the signification of that word but must go a little further and inquire into the nature,JohnLocke,,
345,of common words are certainly established and the precise ideas they stand for perfectly known and that it is a shame to be ignorant of them both which suppositions are false no names of complex ideas having so settled determined significations that they are constantly used for the same precise ideas nor is it a shame for a man to have a certain knowledge of anything but by the necessary ways of attaining it and so it is no discredit not to know what precise idea any sound stands for in another mans mind without he declare it to me by some other way than barely using that sound there being no other way without such a declaration certainly to know it indeed the necessity of communication by language brings men to an agreement in the signification of common words within some tolerable latitude that may serve for ordinary conversation and,JohnLocke,,

347,are presented in our ideas and words logica chapter i of knowledge in general 1 our knowledge conversant about our ideas only since the mind in all its thoughts and reasonings hath no other immediate object but its own ideas which it alone does or can contemplate it is evident that our knowledge is only conversant about them 2 knowledge is the perception of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas knowledge then seems to me to be nothing but the perception of the connexion of and agreement or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our ideas in this alone it consists where this perception is there is knowledge and where it is not there though we may fancy guess or believe yet we always come short of knowledge for when we know that white is not black what do we else but perceive that these two ideas do not agree,JohnLocke,,
348,whose identity and diversity will always be perceived as soon and clearly as the ideas themselves are nor can it possibly be otherwise 5 secondly of abstract relations between ideas secondly the next sort of agreement or disagreement the mind perceives in any of its ideas may i think be called relative and is nothing but the perception of the relation between any two ideas of what kind soever whether substances modes or any other for since all distinct ideas must eternally be known not to be the same and so be universally and constantly denied one of another there could be no room for any positive knowledge at all if we could not perceive any relation between our ideas and find out the agreement or disagreement they have one with another in several ways the mind takes of comparing them 6 thirdly of their necessary coexistence in substances thirdly the,JohnLocke,,
349,knowledge we have or are capable of for all the inquiries we can make concerning any of our ideas all that we know or can affirm concerning any of them is that it is or is not the same with some other that it does or does not always coexist with some other idea in the same subject that it has this or that relation with some other idea or that it has a real existence without the mind thus blue is not yellow is of identity two triangles upon equal bases between two parallels are equal is of relation iron is susceptible of magnetical impressions is of coexistence god is is of real existence though identity and coexistence are truly nothing but relations yet they are such peculiar ways of agreement or disagreement of our ideas that they deserve well to be considered as distinct heads and not under relation,JohnLocke,,
350,the idea that shows him that if the three angles of a triangle were once equal to two right ones they will always be equal to two right ones and hence he comes to be certain that what was once true in the case is always true what ideas once agreed will always agree and consequently what he once knew to be true he will always know to be true as long as he can remember that he once knew it upon this ground it is that particular demonstrations in mathematics afford general knowledge if then the perception that the same ideas will eternally have the same habitudes and relations be not a sufficient ground of knowledge there could be no knowledge of general propositions in mathematics for no mathematical demonstration would be any other than particular and when a man had demonstrated any proposition concerning one triangle or circle his,JohnLocke,,
351,not be amiss to consider a little the degrees of its evidence the different clearness of our knowledge seems to me to lie in the different way of perception the mind has of the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas for if we will reflect on our own ways of thinking we will find that sometimes the mind perceives the agreement or disagreement of two ideas immediately by themselves without the intervention of any other and this i think we may call intuitive knowledge for in this the mind is at no pains of proving or examining but perceives the truth as the eye doth light only by being directed towards it thus the mind perceives that white is not black that a circle is not a triangle that three are more than two and equal to one and two such kinds of truths the mind perceives at the,JohnLocke,,
352,which the three angles of a triangle have an equality and finding those equal to two right ones comes to know their equality to two right ones 3 demonstration depends on clearly perceived proofs those intervening ideas which serve to show the agreement of any two others are called proofs and where the agreement and disagreement is by this means plainly and clearly perceived it is called demonstration it being shown to the understanding and the mind made to see that it is so a quickness in the mind to find out these intermediate ideas that shall discover the agreement or disagreement of any other and to apply them right is i suppose that which is called sagacity 4 as certain but not so easy and ready as intuitive knowledge this knowledge by intervening proofs though it be certain yet the evidence of it is not altogether so clear and bright,JohnLocke,,
353,the agreement or disagreement of the ideas it considers yet it is not without pains and attention there must be more than one transient view to find it a steady application and pursuit are required to this discovery and there must be a progression by steps and degrees before the mind can in this way arrive at certainty and come to perceive the agreement or repugnancy between two ideas that need proofs and the use of reason to show it 5 the demonstrated conclusion not without doubt precedent to the demonstration another difference between intuitive and demonstrative knowledge is that though in the latter all doubt be removed when by the intervention of the intermediate ideas the agreement or disagreement is perceived yet before the demonstration there was a doubt which in intuitive knowledge cannot happen to the mind that has its faculty of perception left to a degree capable of,JohnLocke,,
354,paper and so if the mind have the faculty of distinct perception it will perceive the agreement or disagreement of those ideas that produce intuitive knowledge if the eyes have lost the faculty of seeing or the mind of perceiving we in vain inquire after the quickness of sight in one or clearness of perception in the other 6 not so clear as intuitive knowledge it is true the perception produced by demonstration is also very clear yet it is often with a great abatement of that evident lustre and full assurance that always accompany that which i call intuitive like a face reflected by several mirrors one to another where as long as it retains the similitude and agreement with the object it produces a knowledge but it is still in every successive reflection with a lessening of that perfect clearness and distinctness which is in the first till at,JohnLocke,,
355,that this is more imperfect than intuitive knowledge and men embrace often falsehood for demonstrations 8 hence the mistake ex praecognitis et praeconcessis the necessity of this intuitive knowledge in each step of scientifical or demonstrative reasoning gave occasion i imagine to that mistaken axiom that all reasoning was ex praecognitis et praeconcessis which how far it is a mistake i shall have occasion to show more at large when i come to consider propositions and particularly those propositions which are called maxims and to show that it is by a mistake that they are supposed to be the foundations of all our knowledge and reasonings 9 demonstration not limited to ideas of mathematical quantity it has been generally taken for granted that mathematics alone are capable of demonstrative certainty but to have such an agreement or disagreement as may intuitively be perceived being as i imagine not the privilege of,JohnLocke,,

357,measure them by nor means to distinguish every the least real difference the only help we have being from our senses which in this point fail us but where the difference is so great as to produce in the mind clearly distinct ideas whose differences can be perfectly retained there these ideas or colours as we see in different kinds as blue and red are as capable of demonstration as ideas of number and extension what i have here said of whiteness and colours i think holds true in all secondary qualities and their modes 14 iii sensitive knowledge of the particular existence of finite beings without us these two viz intuition and demonstration are the degrees of our knowledge whatever comes short of one of these with what assurance soever embraced is but faith or opinion but not knowledge at least in all general truths there is indeed another perception,JohnLocke,,

359,immediate application and therefore there is need of some intervening qualities to measure them by which is demonstration or rational knowledge 4 fourthly nor does demonstrative knowledge fourthly it follows also from what is above observed that our rational knowledge cannot reach to the whole extent of our ideas because between two different ideas we would examine we cannot always find such mediums as we can connect one to another with an intuitive knowledge in all the parts of the deduction and wherever that fails we come short of knowledge and demonstration 5 fifthly sensitive knowledge narrower than either fifthly sensitive knowledge reaching no further than the existence of things actually present to our senses is yet much narrower than either of the former 6 sixthly our knowledge therefore narrower than our ideas sixthly from all which it is evident that the extent of our knowledge comes not only short of,JohnLocke,,

361,thinking but possibly shall never be able to know whether any mere material being thinks or no it being impossible for us by the contemplation of our own ideas without revelation to discover whether omnipotency has not given to some systems of matter fitly disposed a power to perceive and think or else joined and fixed to matter so disposed a thinking immaterial substance it being in respect of our notions not much more remote from our comprehension to conceive that god can if he pleases superadd to matter a faculty of thinking than that he should superadd to it another substance with a faculty of thinking since we know not wherein thinking consists nor to what sort of substances the almighty has been pleased to give that power which cannot be in any created being but merely by the good pleasure and bounty of the creator for i see no,JohnLocke,,
362,being that of vision we must in many things content ourselves with faith and probability and in the present question about the immateriality of the soul if our faculties cannot arrive at demonstrative certainty we need not think it strange all the great ends of morality and religion are well enough secured without philosophical proofs of the souls immateriality since it is evident that he who made us at the beginning to subsist here sensible intelligent beings and for several years continued us in such a state can and will restore us to the like state of sensibility in another world and make us capable there to receive the retribution he has designed to men according to their doings in this life and therefore it is not of such mighty necessity to determine one way or the other as some overzealous for or against the immateriality of the soul have been,JohnLocke,,

364,see and know the nature and inward constitution of things how much must they exceed us in knowledge to which if we add larger comprehension which enables them at one glance to see the connexion and agreement of very many ideas and readily supplies to them the intermediate proofs which we by single and slow steps and long poring in the dark hardly at last find out and are often ready to forget one before we have hunted out another we may guess at some part of the happiness of superior ranks of spirits who have a quicker and more penetrating sight as well as a larger field of knowledge but to return to the argument in hand our knowledge i say is not only limited to the paucity and imperfections of the ideas we have and which we employ it about but even comes short of that too but how,JohnLocke,,
365,a very little way secondly as to the second sort which is the agreement or disagreement of our ideas in coexistence in this our knowledge is very short though in this consists the greatest and most material part of our knowledge concerning substances for our ideas of the species of substances being as i have showed nothing but certain collections of simple ideas united in one subject and so coexisting together vg our idea of flame is a body hot luminous and moving upward of gold a body heavy to a certain degree yellow malleable and fusible for these or some such complex ideas as these in mens minds do these two names of the different substances flame and gold stand for when we would know anything further concerning these or any other sort of substances what do we inquire but what other qualities or powers these substances have or have,JohnLocke,,
366,with any other simple ideas whose coexistence with them we would inform ourselves about 11 especially of the secondary qualities of bodies the ideas that our complex ones of substances are made up of and about which our knowledge concerning substances is most employed are those of their secondary qualities which depending all as has been shown upon the primary qualities of their minute and insensible parts or if not upon them upon something yet more remote from our comprehension it is impossible we should know which have a necessary union or inconsistency one with another for not knowing the root they from not knowing what size figure and texture of parts they are on which depend and from which result those qualities which make our complex idea of gold it is impossible we should know what other qualities result from or are incompatible with the same constitution of the insensible,JohnLocke,,

369,the idea of ourselves as understanding rational creatures being such as are clear in us would i suppose if duly considered and pursued afford such foundations of our duty and rules of action as might place morality amongst the sciences capable of demonstration wherein i doubt not but from selfevident propositions by necessary consequences as incontestible as those in mathematics the measures of right and wrong might be made out to any one that will apply himself with the same indifferency and attention to the one as he does to the other of these sciences the relation of other modes may certainly be perceived as well as those of number and extension and i cannot see why they should not also be capable of demonstration if due methods were thought on to examine or pursue their agreement or disagreement where there is no property there is no injustice is a proposition,JohnLocke,,
370,of the least change in the ideas this cannot be thus done in moral ideas we have no sensible marks that resemble them whereby we can set them down we have nothing but words to express them by which though when written they remain the same yet the ideas they stand for may change in the same man and it is very seldom that they are not different in different persons secondly another thing that makes the greater difficulty in ethics is that moral ideas are commonly more complex than those of the figures ordinarily considered in mathematics from whence these two inconveniences followfirst that their names are of more uncertain signification the precise collection of simple ideas they stand for not being so easily agreed on and so the sign that is used for them in communication always and in thinking often does not steadily carry with it the same,JohnLocke,,
371,in one view before him the result of all his perceptions and reasonings 20 remedies of our difficulties in dealing demonstratively with moral ideas one part of these disadvantages in moral ideas which has made them be thought not capable of demonstration may in a good measure be remedied by definitions setting down that collection of simple ideas which every term shall stand for and then using the terms steadily and constantly for that precise collection and what methods algebra or something of that kind may hereafter suggest to remove the other difficulties it is not easy to foretell confident i am that if men would in the same method and with the same indifferency search after moral as they do mathematical truths they would find them have a stronger connexion one with another and a more necessary consequence from our clear and distinct ideas and to come nearer perfect demonstration,JohnLocke,,

374,natural operations our want of precise distinct ideas of their primary qualities keeps us in an incurable ignorance of what we desire to know about them i doubt not but if we could discover the figure size texture and motion of the minute constituent parts of any two bodies we should know without trial several of their operations one upon another as we do now the properties of a square or a triangle did we know the mechanical affections of the particles of rhubarb hemlock opium and a man as a watchmaker does those of a watch whereby it performs its operations and of a file which by rubbing on them will alter the figure of any of the wheels we should be able to tell beforehand that rhubarb will purge hemlock kill and opium make a man sleep as well as a watchmaker can that a little piece of paper,JohnLocke,,
375,scientifical will still be out of our reach because we want perfect and adequate ideas of those very bodies which are nearest to us and most under our command those which we have ranked into classes under names and we think ourselves best acquainted with we have but very imperfect and incomplete ideas of distinct ideas of the several sorts of bodies that fall under the examination of our senses perhaps we may have but adequate ideas i suspect we have not of any one amongst them and though the former of these will serve us for common use and discourse yet whilst we want the latter we are not capable of scientifical knowledge nor shall ever be able to discover general instructive unquestionable truths concerning them certainty and demonstration are things we must not in these matters pretend to by the colour figure taste and smell and other sensible qualities,JohnLocke,,
376,much as guess much less know their manner of production thus having no ideas of the particular mechanical affections of the minute parts of bodies that are within our view and reach we are ignorant of their constitutions powers and operations and of bodies more remote we are yet more ignorant not knowing so much as their very outward shapes or the sensible and grosser parts of their constitutions 27 much less a science of unembodied spirits this at first will show us how disproportionate our knowledge is to the whole extent even of material beings to which if we add the consideration of that infinite number of spirits that may be and probably are which are yet more remote from our knowledge whereof we have no cognizance nor can frame to ourselves any distinct ideas of their several ranks and sorts we shall find this cause of ignorance conceal from,JohnLocke,,

378,our bodies is as inconceivable how any thought should produce a motion in body is as remote from the nature of our ideas as how any body should produce any thought in the mind that it is so if experience did not convince us the consideration of the things themselves would never be able in the least to discover to us these and the like though they have a constant and regular connexion in the ordinary course of things yet that connexion being not discoverable in the ideas themselves which appearing to have no necessary dependence one on another we can attribute their connexion to nothing else but the arbitrary determination of that who has made them to be and to operate as they do in a way wholly above our weak understandings to conceive 29 instances in some of our ideas there are certain relations habitudes and connexions so visibly,JohnLocke,,
379,want of finding out those intermediate ideas which may show us what habitude of agreement or disagreement they have one with another and thus many are ignorant of mathematical truths not out of any imperfection of their faculties or uncertainty in the things themselves but for want of application in acquiring examining and by due ways comparing those ideas that which has most contributed to hinder the due tracing of our ideas and finding out their relations and agreements or disagreements one with another has been i suppose the ill use of words it is impossible that men should ever truly seek or certainly discover the agreement or disagreement of ideas themselves whilst their thoughts flutter about or stick only in sounds of doubtful and uncertain significations mathematicians abstracting their thoughts from names and accustoming themselves to set before their minds the ideas themselves that they would consider and not sounds,JohnLocke,,
380,is there anything so extravagant as the imaginations of mens brains where is the head that has no chimeras in it or if there be a sober and a wise man what difference will there be by your rules between his knowledge and that of the most extravagant fancy in the world they both have their ideas and perceive their agreement and disagreement one with another if there be any difference between them the advantage will be on the warmheaded mans side as having the more ideas and the more lively and so by your rules he will be the more knowing if it be true that all knowledge lies only in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own ideas the visions of an enthusiast and the reasonings of a sober man will be equally certain it is no matter how things are so a man observe but,JohnLocke,,
381,be as strongholds of truth as the demonstrations of euclid that an harpy is not a is by this way as certain knowledge and as much a truth as that a square is not a circle but of what use is all this fine knowledge of mens own imaginations to a man that inquires after the reality of things it matters not what mens fancies are it is the knowledge of things that is only to be prized it is this alone gives a value to our reasonings and preference to one mans knowledge over anothers that it is of things as they really are and not of dreams and fancies 2 answer not so where ideas agree with things to which i answer that if our knowledge of our ideas terminate in them and reach no further where there is something further intended our most serious thoughts will be of,JohnLocke,,
382,it will be easily granted that the knowledge we have of mathematical truths is not only certain but real knowledge and not the bare empty vision of vain insignificant chimeras of the brain and yet if we will consider we shall find that it is only of our own ideas the mathematician considers the truth and properties belonging to a rectangle or circle only as they are in idea in his own mind for it is possible he never found either of them existing mathematically ie precisely true in his life but yet the knowledge he has of any truths or properties belonging to a circle or any other mathematical figure are nevertheless true and certain even of real things existing because real things are no further concerned nor intended to be meant by any such propositions than as things really agree to those archetypes in his mind is it true,JohnLocke,,
383,who pretend to make it their business to inquire after truth and certainty will i presume upon examination be found to be general propositions and notions in which existence is not at all concerned all the discourses of the mathematicians about the squaring of a circle conic sections or any other part of mathematics concern not the existence of any of those figures but their demonstrations which depend on their ideas are the same whether there be any square or circle existing in the world or no in the same manner the truth and certainty of moral discourses abstracts from the lives of men and the existence of those virtues in the world whereof they treat nor are less true because there is nobody in the world that exactly practises his rules and lives up to that pattern of a virtuous man which he has given us and which existed nowhere,JohnLocke,,
384,the idea under consideration from the sign that stands for it our knowledge goes equally on in the discovery of real truth and certainty whatever sounds we make use of 10 misnaming disturbs not the certainty of the knowledge one thing more we are to take notice of that where god or any other lawmaker hath defined any moral names there they have made the essence of that species to which that name belongs and there it is not safe to apply or use them otherwise but in other cases it is bare impropriety of speech to apply them contrary to the common usage of the country but yet even this too disturbs not the certainty of that knowledge which is still to be had by a due contemplation and comparing of those even nicknamed ideas 11 thirdly our complex ideas of substances have their archetypes without us and here knowledge,JohnLocke,,
385,if we rightly consider and confine not our thoughts and abstract ideas to names as if there were or could be no other sorts of things than what known names had already determined and as it were set out we should think of things with greater freedom and less confusion than perhaps we do it would possibly be thought a bold paradox if not a very dangerous falsehood if i should say that some changelings who have lived forty years together without any appearance of reason are something between a man and a beast which prejudice is founded upon nothing else but a false supposition that these two names man and beast stand for distinct species so set out by real essences that there can come no other species between them whereas if we will abstract from those names and the supposition of such specific essences made by nature wherein all,JohnLocke,,
386,is no more but an accidental difference between themselves and changelings the essence in both being exactly the same to consider whether they can imagine immortality annexed to any outward shape of the body the very proposing it is i suppose enough to make them disown it no one yet that ever i heard of how much soever immersed in matter allowed that excellency to any figure of the gross sensible outward consequence of it or that any mass of matter should after its dissolution here be again restored hereafter to an everlasting state of sense perception and knowledge only because it was moulded into this or that figure and had such a particular frame of its visible parts such an opinion as this placing immortality in a certain superficial figure turns out of doors all consideration of soul or spirit upon whose account alone some corporeal beings have hitherto been,JohnLocke,,
387,in the common phrase the far more essential part not shall the want of a nose or a neck make a monster and put such issue out of the rank of men the want of reason and understanding not this is to bring all back again to what was exploded just now this is to place all in the shape and to take the measure of a man only by his outside to show that according to the ordinary way of reasoning in this matter people do lay the whole stress on the figure and resolve the whole essence of the species of man as they make it into the outward shape how unreasonable soever it be and how much soever they disown it we need but trace their thoughts and practice a little further and then it will plainly appear the wellshaped changeling is a man has a rational soul,JohnLocke,,
388,begin to boggle make the face yet narrower flatter and longer and then you are at a stand add still more and more of the likeness of a brute to it and let the head be perfectly that of some other animal then presently it is a monster and it is demonstration with you that it hath no rational soul and must be destroyed where now i ask shall be the just measure which the utmost bounds of that shape that carries with it a rational soul for since there have been human foetuses produced half beast and half man and others three parts one and one part the other and so it is possible they may be in all the variety of approaches to the one or the other shape and may have several degrees of mixture of the likeness of a man or a brutei would gladly know what,JohnLocke,,
389,the word monster signifies anything at all but something neither man nor beast but partaking somewhat of either and just so is the changeling before mentioned so necessary is it to quit the common notion of species and essences if we will truly look into the nature of things and examine them by what our faculties can discover in them as they exist and not by groundless fancies that have been taken up about them 17 words and species i have mentioned this here because i think we cannot be too cautious that words and species in the ordinary notions which we have been used to of them impose not on us for i am apt to think therein lies one great obstacle to our clear and distinct knowledge especially in reference to substances and from thence has rose a great part of the difficulties about truth and certainty would we,JohnLocke,,
390,names but when we would consider or make propositions about the more complex ideas as of a man vitriol fortitude glory we usually put the name for the idea because the ideas these names stand for being for the most part imperfect confused and undetermined we reflect on the names themselves because they are more clear certain and distinct and readier occur to our thoughts than the pure ideas and so we make use of these words instead of the ideas themselves even when we would meditate and reason within ourselves and make tacit mental propositions in substances as has been already noticed this is occasioned by the imperfections of our ideas we making the name stand for the real essence of which we have no idea at all in modes it is occasioned by the great number of simple ideas that go to the making them up for many of,JohnLocke,,
391,precise ideas the most of them stood for some confused or obscure notions have served their turns and many who talk very much of religion and conscience of church and faith of power and right of obstructions and humours melancholy and choler would perhaps have little left in their thoughts and meditations if one should desire them to think only of the things themselves and lay by those words with which they so often confound others and not seldom themselves also 5 mental and verbal propositions contrasted but to return to the consideration of truth we must i say observe two sorts of propositions that we are capable of making first mental wherein the ideas in our understandings are without the use of words put together or separated by the mind perceiving or judging of their agreement or disagreement secondly verbal propositions which are words the signs of our ideas put,JohnLocke,,
392,of the idea of animal with that of is as clear and visable to the mind as the agreement of the idea of animal with that of man and so these two propositions are equally true equally certain but of what use is all such truth to us 8 answered real truth is about ideas agreeing to things though what has been said in the foregoing chapter to distinguish real from imaginary knowledge might suffice here in answer to this doubt to distinguish real truth from chimerical or if you please barely nominal they depending both on the same foundation yet it may not be amiss here again to consider that though our words signify things the truth they contain when put into propositions will be only verbal when they stand for ideas in the mind that have not an agreement with the reality of things and therefore truth as well,JohnLocke,,
393,marked by those words 10 general propositions to be treated of more at large but because words are looked on as the great conduits of truth and knowledge and that in conveying and receiving of truth and commonly in reasoning about it we make use of words and propositions i shall more at large inquire wherein the certainty of real truths contained in propositions consists and where it is to be had and endeavour to show in what sort of universal propositions we are capable of being certain of their real truth or falsehood i shall begin with general propositions as those which most employ our thoughts and exercise our contemplation general truths are most looked after by the mind as those that most enlarge our knowledge and by their comprehensiveness satisfying us at once of many particulars enlarge our view and shorten our way to knowledge 11 moral and truth,JohnLocke,,
394,whereby it is made to be of that species we cannot be certain of the truth of any affirmation or negation made of it for man or gold taken in this sense and used for species of things constituted by real essences different from the complex idea in the mind of the speaker stand for we know not what and the extent of these species with such boundaries are so unknown and undetermined that it is impossible with any certainty to affirm that all men are rational or that all gold is yellow but where the nominal essence is kept to as the boundary of each species and men extend the application of any general term no further than to the particular things in which the complex idea it stands for is to be found there they are in no danger to mistake the bounds of each species nor can be,JohnLocke,,
395,more particularly concerns substances the names of substances then whenever made to stand for species which are supposed to be constituted by real essences which we know not are not capable to convey certainty to the understanding of the truth general propositions made up of such terms we cannot be sure the reason whereof is plain for how can we be sure that this or that quality is in gold when we know not what is or is not gold since in this way of speaking nothing is gold but what partakes of an essence which we not knowing cannot know where it is or is not and so cannot be sure that any parcel of matter in the world is or is not in this sense gold being incurably ignorant whether it has or has not that which makes anything to be called gold i e that real essence of,JohnLocke,,
396,no necessary connexion that we can discover with the colour weight or any other simple idea of our complex one or with the whole combination together it is impossible that we should certainly know the truth of this proposition that all gold is fixed 9 no discoverable necessary connexion between nominal essence gold and other simple ideas as there is no discoverable connexion between fixedness and the colour weight and other simple ideas of that nominal essence of gold so if we make our complex idea of gold a body yellow fusable ductile weighty and fixed we shall be at the same uncertainty concerning solubility in aqua regia and for the same reason since we can never from consideration of the ideas themselves with certainty affirm or deny of a body whose complex idea is made up of yellow very weighty ductile fusible and fixed that it is soluble in aqua,JohnLocke,,
397,liquor and not in anotherif i say we had such an idea as this of bodies and could perceive wherein all sensible qualities originally consist and how they are produced we might frame such abstract ideas of them as would furnish us with matter of more general knowledge and enable us to make universal propositions that should carry general truth and certainty with them but whilst our complex ideas of the sorts of substances are so remote from that internal real constitution on which their sensible qualities depend and are made up of nothing but an imperfect collection of those apparent qualities our senses can discover there can be few general propositions concerning substances of whose real truth we can be certainly assured since there are but few simple ideas of whose connexion and necessary coexistence we can have certain and undoubted knowledge i imagine amongst all the secondary qualities of,JohnLocke,,
398,ideas it is not to be wondered that we can with them make very few general propositions of undoubted real certainty but yet so far as any complex idea of any sort of substances contains in it any simple idea whose necessary coexistence with any other may be discovered so far universal propositions may with certainty be made concerning it vg could any one discover a necessary connexion between malleableness and the colour or weight of gold or any other part of the complex idea signified by that name he might make a certain universal proposition concerning gold in this respect and the real truth of this proposition that all gold is malliable would be as certain as of this the three angles of all rightlined triangles are all equal to two right ones 11 the qualities which make our complex ideas of substances depend mostly on external remote and unperceived,JohnLocke,,
399,itself would cease to be fluid but if inanimate bodies owe so much of their present state to other bodies without them that they would not be what they appear to us were those bodies that environ them removed it is yet more so in vegetables which are nourished grow and produce leaves flowers and seeds in a constant succession and if we look a little nearer into the state of animals we shall find that their dependence as to life motion and the most considerable qualities to be observed in them is so wholly on extrinsical causes and qualities of other bodies that make no part of them that they cannot subsist a moment without them though yet those bodies on which they depend are little taken notice of and make no part of the complex ideas we frame of those animals take the air but for a minute from,JohnLocke,,
400,and perceive some of the motions and grosser operations of things here about us but whence the streams come that keep all these curious machines in motion and repair how conveyed and modified is beyond our notice and apprehension and the great parts and wheels as i may so say of this stupendous structure of the universe may for aught we know have such a connexion and dependence in their influences and operations one upon another that perhaps things in this our mansion would put on quite another face and cease to be what they are if some one of the stars or great bodies incomprehensibly remote from us should cease to be or move as it does this is certain things however absolute and entire they seem in themselves are but retainers to other parts of nature for that which they are most taken notice of by us their observable,JohnLocke,,
401,we observe in them and of which our complex ideas of them are made up this consideration alone is enough to put an end to all our hopes of ever having the ideas of their real essences which whilst we want the nominal essences we make use of instead of them will be able to furnish us but very sparingly with any general knowledge or universal propositions capable of real certainty 13 judgment of probability concerning substances may reach further but that is not knowledge we are not therefore to wonder if certainty be to be found in very few general propositions made concerning substances our knowledge of their qualities and properties goes very seldom further than our senses reach and inform us possibly inquisitive and observing men may by strength of judgment penetrate further and on probabilities taken from wary observation and hints well laid together often guess right at,JohnLocke,,
402,every body will allow is utterly impossible to be known by us without revelation nor if it were revealed to us what sort of figure bulk and motion of corpuscles would produce in us the sensation of a yellow colour and what sort of figure bulk and texture of parts in the superficies of any body were fit to give such corpuscles their due motion to produce that colour would that be enough to make universal propositions with certainty concerning the several sorts of them unless we had faculties acute enough to perceive the precise bulk figure texture and motion of bodies in those minute parts by which they operate on our senses so that we might by those frame our abstract ideas of them i have mentioned here only corporeal substances whose operations seem to lie more level to our understandings for as to the operations of spirits both their,JohnLocke,,
403,observations without us our knowledge goes not beyond particulars it is the contemplation of our own abstract ideas that alone is able to afford us general knowledge chapter vii of maxims 1 maxims or axioms are selfevident propositions there are a sort of propositions which under the name of maxims and axioms have passed for principles of science and because they are selfevident have been supposed innate without that anybody that i know ever went about to show the reason and foundation of their clearness or cogency it may however be worth while to inquire into the reason of their evidence and see whether it be peculiar to them alone and also to examine how far they influence and govern our other knowledge 2 where in that selfevidence consists knowledge as has been shown consists in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas now where that agreement or disagreement,JohnLocke,,
404,finds in those ideas answering the affirmation or negation in the proposition 3 self evidence not peculiar to received axioms this being so in the next place let us consider whether this selfevidence be peculiar only to those propositions which commonly pass under the name of maxims and have the dignity of axioms allowed them and here it is plain that several other truths not allowed to be axioms partake equally with them in this selfevidence this we shall see if we go over these several sorts of agreement or disagreement of ideas which i have above mentioned viz identity relation coexistence and real existence which will discover to us that not only those few propositions which have had the credit of maxims are selfevident but a great many even almost an infinite number of other propositions are such 4 as to identity and diversity all propositions are equally selfevident i,JohnLocke,,
405,add nothing to the evidence or certainty of its knowledge just so it is as every one may experiment in himself in all the ideas a man has in his mind he knows each to be itself and not to be another and to be in his mind and not away when it is there with a certainty that cannot be greater and therefore the truth of no general proposition can be known with a greater certainty nor add anything to this so that in respect of identity our intuitive knowledge reaches as far as our ideas and we are capable of making as many selfevident propositions as we have names for distinct ideas and i appeal to every ones own mind whether this proposition a circle is a circle be not as selfevident a proposition as that consisting of more general terms whatsoever is is and again whether this proposition,JohnLocke,,
406,these two things first that these axioms are those truths that are first known to the mind and secondly that upon them the other parts of our knowledge depend 9 because maxims or axioms are not the truths we first knew first that they are not the truths first known to the mind is evident to experience as we have shown in another place book i chap 1 who perceives not that a child certainly knows that a stranger is not its mother that its suckingbottle is not the rod long before he knows that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and how many truths are there about numbers which it is obvious to observe that the mind is perfectly acquainted with and fully convinced of before it ever thought on these general maxims to which mathematicians in their arguings do sometimes refer them,JohnLocke,,
407,great many that we know before them it is impossible they should be the principles from which we deduce all other truths is it impossible to know that one and two are equal to three but by virtue of this or some such axiom viz the whole is equal to all its parts taken together many a one knows that one and two are equal to three without having heard or thought on that or any other axiom by which it might be proved and knows it as certainly as any other man knows that the whole is equal to all its parts or any other maxim and all from the same reason of selfevidence the equality of those ideas being as visible and certain to him without that or any other axiom as with it it needing no proof to make it perceived nor after the knowledge that the whole,JohnLocke,,

409,that led him into the discovery of the truth and certainty of those propositions nor was it by them that he got the knowledge of those demonstrations but by finding out intermediate ideas that showed the agreement or disagreement of the ideas as expressed in the propositions he demonstrated this is the greatest exercise and improvement of human understanding in the enlarging of knowledge and advancing the sciences wherein they are far enough from receiving any help from the contemplation of these or the like magnified maxims would those who have this traditional admiration of these propositions that they think no step can be made in knowledge without the support of an axiom no stone laid in the building of the sciences without a general maxim but distinguish between the method of acquiring knowledge and of communicating it between the method of raising any science and that of teaching it to,JohnLocke,,
410,schools which being such as all men allowed and agreed in were looked on as general measures of truth and served instead of principles where the disputants had not lain down any other between them beyond which there was no going and which must not be receded from by either side and thus these maxims getting the name of principles beyond which men in dispute could not retreat were by mistake taken to be the originals and sources from whence all knowledge began and the foundations whereon the sciences were built because when in their disputes they came to any of these they stopped there and went no further the matter was determined but how much this is a mistake hath been already shown how maxims came to be so much in vogue this method of the schools which have been thought the fountains of knowledge introduced as i suppose the,JohnLocke,,

412,may also pass for maxims but yet masters of mathematics when they would as teachers of what they know initiate others in that science do not without reason place this and some other such maxims at the entrance of their systems that their scholars having in the beginning perfectly acquainted their thoughts with these propositions made in such general terms may be used to make such reflections and have these more general propositions as formed rules and sayings ready to apply to all particular cases not that if they be equally weighed they are more clear and evident than the particular instances they are brought to confirm but that being more familiar to the mind the very naming them is enough to satisfy the understanding but this i say is more from our custom of using them and the establishment they have got in our minds by our often thinking of,JohnLocke,,
413,must remain broken and mysterious in the human understanding by which familiar use of them as rules to measure the truth of other propositions it comes in time to be thought that more particular propositions have their truth and evidence from their conformity to these more general ones which in discourse and argumentation are so frequently urged and constantly admitted and this i think to be the reason why amongst so many selfevident propositions the most general only have had the title of maxims 12 maxims if care be not taken in the use of words may prove contradictions one thing further i think it may not be amiss to observe concerning these general maxims that they are so far from improving or establishing our minds in true knowledge that if our notions be wrong loose or unsteady and we resign up our thoughts to the sound of words rather than,JohnLocke,,
414,i have made this remark in all that is here suggested concerning their little use for the improvement of knowledge or dangerous use in undetermined ideas i have been far enough from saying or intending they should be laid aside as some have been too forward to charge me i affirm them to be truths selfevident truths and so cannot be laid aside as far as their influence will reach it is in vain to endeavour nor will i attempt to abridge it but yet without any injury to truth or knowledge i may have reason to think their use is not answerable to the great stress which seems to be laid on them and i may warn men not to make an ill use of them for the confirming themselves in errors 15 they cannot add to our knowledge of substances and their application to complex ideas is dangerous but,JohnLocke,,

416,as selfevident as these upon this ground it is that intuitive knowledge neither requires nor admits any proof one part of it more than another he that will suppose it does takes away the foundation of all knowledge and certainty and he that needs any proof to make him certain and give his assent to this proposition that two are equal to two will also have need of a proof to make him admit that what is is he that needs a probation to convince him that two are not three that white is not black that a triangle is not a circle c or any other two determined distinct ideas are not one and the same will need also a demonstration to convince him that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be 20 their use dangerous where our ideas are not determined and as,JohnLocke,,
417,treated of in the foregoing chapter be of that use to real knowledge as is generally supposed i leave to be considered this i think may confidently be affirmed that there are universal propositions which though they be certainly true yet they add no light to our understanding bring no increase to our knowledge such are 2 as first identical propositions first all purely identical propositions these obviously and at first blush appear to contain no instruction in them for when we affirm the said term of itself whether it be barely verbal or whether it contains any clear and real idea it shows us nothing but what we must certainly know before whether such a proposition be either made by or proposed to us indeed that most general one what is is may serve sometimes to show a man the absurdity he is guilty of when by circumlocution or equivocal,JohnLocke,,
418,of the simple ideas that goes to the making up the complex one the sound gold stands for what can it be but playing with sounds to affirm that of the name gold which is comprehended in its received signification it would be thought little better than ridiculous to affirm gravely as a truth of moment that gold is yellow and i see not how it is any jot more material to say it is fusible unless that quality be left out of the complex idea of which the sound gold is the mark in ordinary speech what instruction can it carry with it to tell one that which he hath been told already or he is supposed to know before for i am supposed to know the signification of the word another uses to me or else he is to tell me and if i know that the name gold,JohnLocke,,
419,anything where any of these was wanting but he that shall tell me that in whatever thing sense motion reason and laughter were united that thing had actually a notion of god or would be cast into a sleep by opium made indeed an instructive proposition because neither having the notion of god nor being cast into sleep by opium being contained in the idea signified by the word man we are by such propositions taught something more than barely what the word man stands for and therefore the knowledge contained in it is more than verbal 7 for this teaches but the signification of words before a man makes any proposition he is supposed to understand the terms he uses in it or else he talks like a parrot only making a noise by imitation and framing certain sounds which he has learnt of others but not as a rational,JohnLocke,,
420,the opposite internal angles making no part of the complex idea signified by the name triangle this is a real truth and conveys with it instructive real knowledge 9 general propositions concerning substances are often trifling we having little or no knowledge of what combinations there be of simple ideas existing together in substances but by our senses we cannot make any universal certain propositions concerning them any further than our nominal essences lead us which being to a very few and inconsiderable truths in respect of those which depend on their real constitutions the general propositions that are made about substances if they are certain are for the most part but trifling and if they are instructive are uncertain and such as we can have no knowledge of their real truth how much soever constant observation and analogy may assist our judgment in guessing hence it comes to pass that,JohnLocke,,
421,in words and yet thereby advance not one jot in the knowledge of the truth of things v g he that having learnt these following words with their ordinary mutual relative acceptations annexed to them v g substance man animal form soul vegetative sensitive rational may make several undoubted propositions about the soul without knowing at all what the soul really is and of this sort a man may find an infinite number of propositions reasonings and conclusions in books of metaphysics schooldivinity and some sort of natural philosophy and after all know as little of god spirits or bodies as he did before he set out 10 and why he that hath liberty to define ie to determine the signification of his names of substances as certainly every one does in effect who makes them stand for his own ideas and makes their significations at a venture taking them from,JohnLocke,,
422,demonstrate them one of another according to those several respects and mutual relations he has given them one to another wherein however things agree or disagree in their own nature he needs mind nothing but his own notions with the names he hath bestowed upon them but thereby no more increases his own knowledge than he does his riches who taking a bag of counters calls one in a certain place a pound another in another place a shilling and a third in a third place a penny and so proceeding may undoubtedly reckon right and cast up a great sum according to his counters so placed and standing for more or less as he pleases without being one jot the richer or without even knowing how much a pound shilling or penny is but only that one is contained in the other twenty times and contains the other twelve which,JohnLocke,,
423,the nature and knowledge of things that they use their words loosely and uncertainly and do not by using them constantly and steadily in the same significations make plain and clear deductions of words one from another and make their discourses coherent and clear how little soever they were instructive which were not difficult to do did they not find it convenient to shelter their ignorance or obstinacy under the obscurity and perplexedness of their terms to which perhaps inadvertency and ill custom do in many men much contribute 12 marks of verbal propositions first predication in abstract to conclude barely verbal propositions may be known by these following marks first all propositions wherein two abstract terms are affirmed one of another are barely about the signification of sounds for since no abstract idea can be the same with any other but itself when its abstract name is affirmed of any,JohnLocke,,
424,in this matter come not short of the highest degree of certainty chapter x of our knowledge of the existence of a god 1 we are capable of knowing certainly that there is a god though god has given us no innate ideas of himself though he has stamped no original characters on our minds wherein we may read his being yet having furnished us with those faculties our minds are endowed with he hath not left himself without witness since we have sense perception and reason and cannot want a clear proof of him as long as we carry ourselves about us nor can we justly complain of our ignorance in this great point since he has so plentifully provided us with the means to discover and know him so far as is necessary to the end of our being and the great concernment of our happiness but though this,JohnLocke,,
425,into itself greater angles than two right ones 6 and therefore god thus from the consideration of ourselves and what we infallibly find in our own constitutions our reason leads us to the knowledge of this certain and evident truththat there is an eternal most powerful and most knowing being which whether any one will please to call god it matters not the thing is evident and from this idea duly considered will easily be deduced all those other attributes which we ought to ascribe to this eternal being if nevertheless any one should be found so senselessly arrogant as to suppose man alone knowing and wise but yet the product of mere ignorance and chance and that all the rest of the universe acted only by that blind haphazard i shall leave with him that very rational and emphatical rebuke of tully 1 ii de leg to be considered at,JohnLocke,,
426,this being of all absurdities the greatest to imagine that pure nothing the perfect negation and absence of all beings should ever produce any real existence it being then unavoidable for all rational creatures to conclude that something has existed from eternity let us next see what kind of thing that must be 9 two sorts of beings cogitative and incogitative there are but two sorts of beings in the world that man knows or conceives first such as are purely material without sense perception or thought as the clippings of our beards and parings of our nails secondly sensible thinking perceiving beings such as we find ourselves to be which if you please we will hereafter call cogitative and incogitative beings which to our present purpose if for nothing else are perhaps better terms than material and immaterial 10 incogitative being cannot produce a cogitative being if then there must,JohnLocke,,
427,that do anywhere exist they knock impel and resist one another just as the greater do and that is all they can do so that if we will suppose nothing first or eternal matter can never begin to be if we suppose bare matter without motion eternal motion can never begin to be if we suppose only matter and motion first or eternal thought can never begin to be for it is impossible to conceive that matter either with or without motion could have originally in and from itself sense perception and knowledge as is evident from hence that then sense perception and knowledge must be a property eternally inseparable from matter and every particle of it not to add that though our general or specific conception of matter makes us speak of it as one thing yet really all matter is not one individual thing neither is there any such,JohnLocke,,
428,that there must be an eternal being and that being must also be knowing yet it does not follow but that thinking being may also be material let it be so it equally still follows that there is a god for there be an eternal omniscient omnipotent being it is certain that there is a god whether you imagine that being to be material or no but herein i suppose lies the danger and deceit of that suppositionthere being no way to avoid the demonstration that there is an eternal knowing being men devoted to matter would willingly have it granted that that knowing being is material and then letting slide out of their minds or the discourse the demonstration whereby an eternal knowing being was proved necessarily to exist would argue all to be matter and so deny a god that is an eternal cogitative being whereby they are so,JohnLocke,,
429,does not think i next ask whether it be only one atom that does so this has as many absurdities as the other for then this atom of matter must be alone eternal or not if this alone be eternal then this alone by its powerful thought or will made all the rest of matter and so we have the creation of matter by a powerful thought which is that the materialists stick at for if they suppose one single thinking atom to have produced all the rest of matter they cannot ascribe that preeminency to it upon any other account than that of its thinking the only supposed difference but allow it to be by some other way which is above our conception it must still be creation and these men must give up their great maxim ex nihilo nil fit if it be said that all the rest of,JohnLocke,,
430,this thinking system be all or a part of the matter of the universe it is impossible that any one particle should either know its own or the motion of any other particle or the whole know the motion of every particle and so regulate its own thoughts or motions or indeed have any thought resulting from such motion 18 matter not coeternal with an eternal mind secondly others would have matter to be eternal notwithstanding that they allow an eternal cogitative immaterial being this though it take not away the being of a god yet since it denies one and the first great piece of his workmanship the creation let us consider it a little matter must be allowed eternal why because you cannot conceive how it can be made out of nothing why do you not also think yourself eternal you will answer perhaps because about twenty or forty,JohnLocke,,
431,it did then it is not eternal but it began to be put together in such a fashion and frame as makes up your body but yet that frame of particles is not you it makes not that thinking thing you are for i have now to do with one who allows an eternal immaterial thinking being but would have unthinking matter eternal too therefore when did that thinking thing begin to be if it did never begin to be then have you always been a thinking thing from eternity the absurdity whereof i need not confute till i meet with one who is so void of understanding as to own it if therefore you can allow a thinking thing to be made out of nothing as all things that are not eternal must be why also can you not allow it possible for a material being to be made out,JohnLocke,,
432,give motion itself since the new determination given to the animal spirits must be either immediately by thought or by some other body put in their way by thought which was not in their way before and so must owe its motion to thought either of which leaves voluntary motion as unintelligible as it was before in the meantime it is an overvaluing ourselves to reduce all to the narrow measure of our capacities and to conclude all things impossible to be done whose manner of doing exceeds our comprehension this is to make our comprehension infinite or god finite when what he can do is limited to what we can conceive of it if you do not understand the operations of your own finite mind that thinking thing within you do not deem it strange that you cannot comprehend the operations of that eternal infinite mind who made and governs,JohnLocke,,
433,eyes which are the proper and sole judges of this thing whose testimony i have reason to rely on as so certain that i can no more doubt whilst i write this that i see white and black and that something really exists that causes that sensation in me than that i write or move my hand which is a certainty as great as human nature is capable of concerning the existence of anything but a mans self alone and of god 3 this notice by our senses though not so certain as demonstration yet may be called knowledge and proves the without us the notice we have by our senses of the existing of things without us though it be not altogether so certain as our intuitive knowledge or the deductions of our reason employed about the clear abstract ideas of our own minds yet it is an assurance that,JohnLocke,,
434,affect them it cannot pass for an illgrounded confidence for i think nobody can in be so sceptical as to be uncertain of the existence of those things which he sees and feels at least he that can doubt so far whatever he may have with his own thoughts will never have any controversy with me since he can never be sure i say anything contrary to his own opinion as to myself i think god has given me assurance enough of the existence of things without me since by their different application i can produce in myself both pleasure and pain which is one great concernment of my present state this is certain the confidence that our faculties do not herein deceive us is the greatest assurance we are capable of concerning the existence of material beings for we cannot act anything but by our faculties nor talk of knowledge,JohnLocke,,
435,those that want the organs of any sense never can have the ideas belonging to that sense produced in their minds this is too evident to be doubted and therefore we cannot but be assured that they come in by the organs of that sense and no other way the organs themselves it is plain do not produce them for then the eyes of a man in the dark would produce colours and his nose smell roses in the but we see nobody gets the relish of a pineapple till he goes to the indies where it is and tastes it 5 ii secondly because we find that an idea from actual sensation and another from memory are very distinct perceptions because sometimes i find that i cannot avoid the having those ideas produced in my mind for though when my eyes are shut or windows fast i can at pleasure,JohnLocke,,
436,from abroad the same may be said of pleasure accompanying several actual sensations and though mathematical demonstration depends not upon sense yet the examining them by diagrams gives great credit to the evidence of our sight and seems to give it a certainty approaching to that of demonstration itself for it would be very strange that a man should allow it for an undeniable truth that two angles of a figure which he measures by lines and angles of a diagram should be bigger one than the other and yet doubt of the existence of those lines and angles which by looking on he makes use of to measure that by 7 iv fourthly because our senses assist one anothers testimony of the existence of outward things and enable us to predict our senses in many cases bear witness to the truth of each others report concerning the existence of sensible,JohnLocke,,
437,his hand in it which certainly could never be put into such exquisite pain by a bare idea or phantom unless that the pain be a fancy too which yet he cannot when the burn is well by raising the idea of it bring upon himself again thus i see whilst i write this i can change the appearance of the paper and by designing the letters tell beforehand what new idea it shall exhibit the very next moment by barely drawing my pen over it which will neither appear let me fancy as much as i will if my hands stand still or though i move my pen if my eyes be shut nor when those characters are once made on the paper can i choose afterwards but see them as they are that is have the ideas of such letters as i have made whence it is manifest that,JohnLocke,,
438,being made acquainted with them 9 but reaches no further than actual sensation in fine then when our senses do actually convey into our understandings any idea we cannot but be satisfied that there doth something at that time really exist without us which doth affect our senses and by them give notice of itself to our apprehensive faculties and actually produce that idea which we then perceive and we cannot so far distrust their testimony as to doubt that such collections of simple ideas as we have observed by our senses to be united together do really exist together but this knowledge extends as far as the present testimony of our senses employed about particular objects that do then affect them and no further for if i saw such a collection of simple ideas as is wont to be called man existing together one minute since and am now alone,JohnLocke,,
439,great likelihood of it puts me past doubt and it be reasonable for me to do several things upon the confidence that there are men and men also of my acquaintance with whom i have to do now in the world but this is but probability not knowledge 10 folly to expect demonstration in everything whereby yet we may observe how foolish and vain a thing it is for a man of a narrow knowledge who having reason given him to judge of the different evidence and probability of things and to be swayed accordingly how vain i say it is to expect demonstration and certainty in things not capable of it and refuse assent to very rational propositions and act contrary to very plain and clear truths because they cannot be made out so evident as to surmount every the least i will not say reason but pretence of doubting,JohnLocke,,
440,such grounds as are capable of no doubt no objection 11 past existence of other things is known by memory as when our senses are actually employed about any object we do know that it does exist so by our memory we may be assured that heretofore things that affected our senses have existed and thus we have knowledge of the past existence of several things whereof our senses having informed us our memories still retain the ideas and of this we are past all doubt so long as we remember well but this knowledge also reaches no further than our senses have formerly assured us thus seeing water at this instant it is an unquestionable truth to me that water doth exist and remembering that i saw it yesterday it will also be always true and as long as my memory retains it always an undoubted proposition to me that,JohnLocke,,
441,not capable of any other knowledge but what our senses give us in this or that particular 13 only particular propositions concerning concrete existances are knowable by which it appears that there are two sorts of propositions1 there is one sort of propositions concerning the existence of anything answerable to such an idea as having the idea of an elephant phoenix motion or an angel in my mind the first and natural inquiry is whether such a thing does anywhere exist and this knowledge is only of particulars no existence of anything without us but only of god can certainly be known further than our senses inform us 2 there is another sort of propositions wherein is expressed the agreement or disagreement of our abstract ideas and their dependence on one another such propositions may be universal and certain so having the idea of god and myself of fear and obedience,JohnLocke,,
442,the influence of these principles nor derived from any peculiar advantage they received from two or three general maxims laid down in the beginning but from the clear distinct complete ideas their thoughts were employed about and the relation of equality and excess so clear between some of them that they had an intuitive knowledge and by that a way to discover it in others and this without the help of those maxims for i ask is it not possible for a young lad to know that his whole body is bigger than his little finger but by virtue of this axiom that the whole is bigger than a part nor be assured of it till he has learned that maxim or cannot a country wench know that having received a shilling from one that owes her three and a shilling also from another that owes her three the remaining debts,JohnLocke,,
443,which are the workmanship of the mind made and names given to them for the easier dispatch in its reasonings and drawing into comprehensive terms and short rules its various and multiplied observations but knowledge began in the mind and was founded on particulars though afterwards perhaps no notice was taken thereof it being natural for the mind forward still to enlarge its knowledge most attentively to lay up those general notions and make the proper use of them which is to disburden the memory of the cumbersome load of particulars for i desire it may be considered what more certainty there is to a child or any one that his body little finger and all is bigger than his little finger alone after you have given to his body the name whole and to his little finger the name part than he could have had before or what new knowledge,JohnLocke,,
444,to know it by the help of these two relative terms whole and part make of them what maxim you please 4 dangerous to build upon precarious principles but be it in the mathematics as it will whether it be clearer that taking an inch from a black line of two inches and an inch from a red line of two inches the remaining parts of the two lines will be equal or that if you take equals from equals the remainder will be equals which i say of these two is the clearer and first known i leave to any one to determine it not being material to my present occasion that which i have here to do is to inquire whether if it be the readiest way to knowledge to begin with general maxims and build upon them it be yet a safe way to take the principles which,JohnLocke,,
445,it again in our days what consequences it will lead us into let any one with take the world or with the stoics the aether or the sun or with anaximenes the air to be god and what a divinity religion and worship must we needs have nothing can be so dangerous as principles thus taken up without questioning or examination especially if they be such as concern morality which influence mens lives and give a bias to all their actions who might not justly expect another kind of life in aristippus who placed happiness in bodily pleasure and in antisthenes who made virtue sufficient to felicity and he who with plato shall place beatitude in the knowledge of god will have his thoughts raised to other contemplations than those who look not beyond this spot of earth and those perishing things which are to be had in it he that,JohnLocke,,
446,those perfect ideas and by comparing them one with another finding their agreement and disagreement and their several relations and habitudes we shall get more true and clear knowledge by the conduct of this one rule than by taking up principles and thereby putting our minds into the disposal of others 7 the true method of advancing knowledge is by considering our abstract ideas we must therefore if we will proceed as reason advises adapt our methods of inquiry to the nature of the ideas we examine and the truth we search after and certain truths are only founded in the habitudes and relations of abstract ideas a sagacious and methodical application of our thoughts for the finding out these relations is the only way to discover all that can be put with truth and certainty concerning them into general propositions by what steps we are to proceed in these is,JohnLocke,,
447,species were pursued in the way familiar to mathematicians they would carry our thoughts further and with greater evidence and clearness than possibly we are apt to imagine 8 by which morality also may be made clearer this gave me the confidence to advance that conjecture which i suggest chap iii viz that morality is capable of demonstration as well as mathematics for the ideas that ethics are conversant about being all real essences and such as i imagine have a discoverable connexion and agreement one with another so far as we can find their habitudes and relations so far we shall be possessed of certain real and general truths and i doubt not but if a right method were taken a great part of morality might be made out with that clearness that could leave to a considering man no more reason to doubt than he could have to doubt,JohnLocke,,
448,see further into the nature of bodies and guess righter at their yet unknown properties than one that is a stranger to them but yet as i have said this is but judgment and opinion not knowledge and certainty this way of getting and improving our knowledge in substances only by experience and history which is all that the weakness of our faculties in this state of mediocrity which we are in this world can attain to makes me suspect that natural philosophy is not capable is being made a science we are able i imagine to reach very little general knowledge concerning the species of bodies and their several properties experiments and historical observations we may have from which we may draw advantages of ease and health and thereby increase our stock of conveniences for this life but beyond this i fear our talents reach not nor are our faculties,JohnLocke,,
449,to disesteem or dissuade the study of nature i readily agree the contemplation of his works gives us occasion to admire revere and glorify their author and if rightly directed may be of greater benefit to mankind than the monuments of exemplary charity that have at so great charge been raised by the founders of hospitals and almshouses he that first invented printing discovered the use of the compass or made public the virtue and right use of did more for the propagation of knowledge for the supply and increase of useful commodities and saved more from the grave than those who built colleges workhouses and hospitals all that i would say is that we should not be too forwardly possessed with the opinion or expectation of knowledge where it is not to be had or by ways that will not attain to it that we should not take doubtful systems,JohnLocke,,
450,use of any probable hypothesis whatsoever hypotheses if they are well made are at least great helps to the memory and often direct us to new discoveries but my meaning is that we should not take up any one too hastily which the mind that would always penetrate into the causes of things and have principles to rest on is very apt to do till we have very well examined particulars and made several experiments in that thing which we would explain by our hypothesis and see whether it will agree to them all whether our principles will carry us quite through and not be as inconsistent with one phenomenon of nature as they seem to accommodate and explain another and at least that we take care that the name of principles deceive us not nor impose on us by making us receive that for an unquestionable truth which is really,JohnLocke,,
451,never sufficiently admire and who knows what methods to enlarge our knowledge in other parts of science may hereafter be invented answering that of algebra in mathematics which so readily finds out the ideas of quantities to measure others by whose equality or proportion we could otherwise very hardly or perhaps never come to know chapter xiii some further considerations concerning our knowledge 1 our knowledge partly necessary partly voluntary our knowledge as in other things so in this has so great a conformity with our sight that it is neither wholly necessary nor wholly voluntary if our knowledge were altogether necessary all mens knowledge would not only be alike but every man would know all that is knowable and if it were wholly voluntary some men so little regard or value it that they would have extreme little or none at all men that have senses cannot choose but receive,JohnLocke,,
452,them and if they have any distinguishing faculty cannot but perceive the agreement or disagreement of some of them one with another as he that has eyes if he will open them by day cannot but see some objects and perceive a difference in them but though a man with his eyes open in the light cannot but see yet there be certain objects which he may choose whether he will turn his eyes to there may be in his reach a book containing pictures and discourses capable to delight or instruct him which yet he may never have the will to open never take the pains to look into 2 the application of our faculties voluntary but they being employed we know as things are not as we please there is also another thing in a mans power and that is though he turns his eyes sometimes towards an object,JohnLocke,,
453,as that the sun shines when he sees it for if he hath but the ideas of two such beings in his mind and will turn his thoughts that way and consider them he will as certainly find that the inferior finite and dependent is under an obligation to obey the supreme and infinite as he is certain to find that three four and seven are less than fifteen if he will consider and compute those numbers nor can he be surer in a clear morning that the sun is risen if he will but open his eyes and turn them that way but yet these truths being ever so certain ever so clear he may be ignorant of either or all of them who will never take the pains to employ his faculties as he should to inform himself about them chapter xiv of judgment 1 our knowledge being short,JohnLocke,,
454,direct him but what has the certainty of true knowledge for that being very short and scanty as we have seen he would be often utterly in the dark and in most of the actions of his life perfectly at a stand had he nothing to guide him in the absence of clear and certain knowledge he that will not eat till he has demonstration that it will nourish him he that will not stir till he infallibly knows the business he goes about will succeed will have little else to do but to sit still and perish 2 what use to be made of as god has set some things in broad daylight as he has given us some certain knowledge though limited to a few things in comparison probably as a taste of what intellectual creatures are capable of to excite in us a desire and endeavour after a,JohnLocke,,
455,the twilight as i may so say of probability suitable i presume to that state of mediocrity and probationership he has been pleased to place us in here wherein to check our overconfidence and presumption we might by every days experience be made sensible of our shortsightedness and liableness to error the sense whereof might be a constant admonition to us to spend the days of this our pilgrimage with industry and care in the search and following of that way which might lead us to a state of greater perfection it being highly rational to think even were revelation silent in the case that as men employ those talents god has given them here they shall accordingly receive their rewards at the close of the day when their sun shall set and night shall put an end to their labours 3 judgement or assent to probability supplies our want of,JohnLocke,,
456,the probability of the thing the proof being such as for the most part carries truth with it the man on whose testimony he receives it not being wont to affirm anything contrary to or besides his knowledge especially in matters of this kind so that that which causes his assent to this proposition that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones that which makes him take these ideas to agree without knowings them to do so is the wonted veracity of the speaker in other cases or his supposed veracity in this 2 it is to supply our want of knowledge our knowledge as has been shown being very narrow and we not happy enough to find certain truth in everything which we have occasion to consider most of the propositions we think reason discoursenay act upon are such as we cannot have undoubted knowledge,JohnLocke,,
457,ought to be examined before we come to a judgment probability wanting that intuitive evidence which infallibly determines the understanding and produces certain knowledge the mind if it will proceed rationally ought to examine all the grounds of probability and see how they make more or less for or against any proposition before it assents to or dissents from it and upon a due balancing the whole reject or receive it with a more or less firm assent proportionably to the preponderancy of the greater grounds of probability on one side or the other for example if i myself see a man walk on the ice it is past probability it is knowledge but if another tells me he saw a man in in the midst of a sharp winter walk upon water hardened with cold this has so great conformity with what is usually observed to happen that i am,JohnLocke,,
458,proposition and as the conformity of our knowledge as the certainty of observations as the frequency and constancy of experience and the number and credibility of testimonies do more or less agree or disagree with it so is any proposition in itself more or less probable there is another i confess which though by itself it be no true ground of probability yet is often made use of for one by which men most commonly regulate their assent and upon which they pin their faith more than anything else and that is the opinion of others though there cannot be a more dangerous thing to rely on nor more likely to mislead one since there is much more falsehood and error among men than truth and knowledge and if the opinions and persuasions of others whom we know and think well of be a ground of assent men have reason to,JohnLocke,,
459,in most very hard even for those who have very admirable memories to retain all the proofs which upon a due examination made them embrace that side of the question it suffices that they have once with care and fairness sifted the matter as far as they could and that they have searched into all the particulars that they could imagine to give any light to the question and with the best of their skill cast up the account upon the whole evidence and thus having once found on which side the probability appeared to them after as full and exact an inquiry as they can make they lay up the conclusion in their memories as a truth they have discovered and for the future they remain satisfied with the testimony of their memories that this is the opinion that by the proofs they have once seen of it deserves such,JohnLocke,,
460,and forbearance in a necessary diversity of opinions since therefore it is unavoidable to the greatest part of men if not all to have several opinions without certain and indubitable proofs of their truth and it carries too great an imputation of ignorance lightness or folly for men to quit and renounce their former tenets presently upon the offer of an argument which they cannot immediately answer and show the insufficiency of it would methinks become all men to maintain peace and the common offices of humanity and friendship in the diversity of opinions since we cannot reasonably expect that any one should readily and obsequiously quit his own opinion and embrace ours with a blind resignation to an authority which the understanding of man acknowledges not for however it may often mistake it can own no other guide but reason nor blindly submit to the will and dictates of another,JohnLocke,,
461,truth on other mens belief which they themselves have not searched into nor weighed the arguments of probability on which they should receive or reject it those who have fairly and truly examined and are thereby got past doubt in all the doctrines they profess and govern themselves by would have a juster pretence to require others to follow them but these are so few in number and find so little reason to be magisterial in their opinions that nothing insolent and imperious is to be expected from them and there is reason to think that if men were better instructed themselves they would be less imposing on others 5 probability is either of sensible matter of fact capable of human testimony or of what is beyond the evidence of our senses but to return to the grounds of assent and the several degrees of it we are to take notice,JohnLocke,,
462,he does of the being and actions of his own acquaintance whereof he himself is a witness 9 experience and testimonies clashing infinitely vary the degrees of probability thus far the matter goes easy enough probability upon such grounds carries so much evidence with it that it naturally determines the judgment and leaves us as little liberty to believe or disbelieve as a demonstration does whether we will know or be ignorant the difficulty is when testimonies contradict common experience and the reports of history and witnesses clash with the ordinary course of nature or with one another there it is where diligence attention and exactness are required to form a right judgment and to proportion the assent to the different evidence and probability of the thing which rises and falls according as those two foundations of credibility viz common observation in like cases and particular testimonies in that particular instance,JohnLocke,,
463,to take notice of a rule observed in the law of which is that though the attested copy of a record be good proof yet the copy of a copy ever so well attested and by ever so credible witnesses will not be admitted as a proof in judicature this is so generally approved as reasonable and suited to the wisdom and caution to be used in our inquiry after material truths that i never yet heard of any one that blamed it this practice if it be allowable in the decisions of right and wrong carries this observation along with it viz that any testimony the further off it is from the original truth the less force and proof it has the being and existence of the thing itself is what i call the original truth a credible man vouching his knowledge of it is a good proof but if,JohnLocke,,
464,in things which sense cannot discover analogy is the great rule of probability secondly the probabilities we have hitherto mentioned are only such as concern matter of fact and such things as are capable of observation and testimony there remains that other sort concerning which men entertain opinions with variety of assent though the things be such that falling not under the reach of our senses they are not capable of testimony such are 1 the existence nature and operations of finite immaterial beings without us as spirits angels devils c or the existence of material beings which either for their smallness in themselves or remoteness from us our senses cannot take notice ofas whether there be any plants animals and intelligent inhabitants in the planets and other mansions of the vast universe 2 concerning the manner of operation in most parts of the works of nature wherein though we see,JohnLocke,,
465,at by him who has the power to change the course of nature there under such circumstances that may be the fitter to procure belief by how much the more they are beyond or contrary to ordinary observation this is the proper case of miracles which well attested do not only find credit themselves but give it also to other truths which need such confirmation 14 the bare testimony of divine revelation is the highest certainty besides those we have hitherto mentioned there is one sort of propositions that challenge the highest degree of our assent upon bare testimony whether the thing proposed agree or disagree with common experience and the ordinary course of things or no the reason whereof is because the testimony is of such an one as cannot deceive nor be deceived and that is of god himself this carries with it an assurance beyond doubt evidence beyond,JohnLocke,,
466,in the one and probability in the other is that which we call reason for as reason perceives the necessary and indubitable connexion of all the ideas or proofs one to another in each step of any demonstration that produces knowledge so it likewise perceives the probable connexion of all the ideas or proofs one to another in every step of a discourse to which it will think assent due this is the lowest degree of that which can be truly called reason for where the mind does not perceive this probable connexion where it does not discern whether there be any such connexion or no there mens opinions are not the product of judgment or the consequence of reason but the effects of chance and hazard of a mind floating at all adventures without choice and without direction 3 reason in its four degrees so that we may in reason,JohnLocke,,
467,these several degrees may be observed in any mathematical demonstration it being one thing to perceive the connexion of each part as the demonstration is made by another another to perceive the dependence of the conclusion on all the parts a third to make out a demonstration clearly and neatly ones self and something different from all these to have first found out these intermediate ideas or proofs by which it is made 4 whether syllogism is the great instrument of reason there is one thing more which i shall desire to be considered concerning reason and that is whether syllogism as is generally thought be the proper instrument of it and the usefullest way of exercising this faculty the causes i have to doubt are these to doubt this first because syllogism serves our reason but in one only of the forementioned parts of it and that is to show,JohnLocke,,
468,the probability which she easily perceives in things thus in their native state would be quite lost if this argument were managed learnedly and proposed in mode and figure for it very often confounds the connexion and i think every one will perceive in mathematical demonstrations that the knowledge gained thereby comes shortest and clearest without syllogism secondly because though syllogism serves to show the force or fallacy of an argument made use of in the usual way of discoursing by supplying the absent proposition and so setting it before the view in a clear light yet it no less engages the mind in the perplexity of obscure equivocal and fallacious terms wherewith this artificial way of reasoning always abounds it being adapted more to the attaining of victory in dispute than the discovery and confirmation of truth in fair enquiries 5 syllogism helps little in demonstration less in probability but,JohnLocke,,
469,iron so he had brought to light but little of that treasure that lay so long hid in the dark entrails of and i am apt to think that he who shall employ all the force of his reason only in brandishing of syllogisms will discover very little of that mass of knowledge which lies yet concealed in the secret recesses of nature and which i am apt to think native rustic reason as it formerly has done is likelier to open a way to and add to the common stock of mankind rather than any scholastic proceeding by the strict rules of mode and figure 7 other helps to reason than syllogism should be sought i doubt not nevertheless but there are ways to be found to assist our reason in this most useful part and this the judicious encourages me to say who in his eccl pol 1 i,JohnLocke,,
470,new and unborrowed i shall have given occasion to others to cast about for new discoveries and to seek in their own thoughts for those right helps of art which will scarce be found i fear by those who servilely confine themselves to the rules and dictates of others for beaten tracks lead this sort of cattle as an observing roman calls them whose thoughts reach only to imitation non quo eundum est sed quo itur but i can be bold to say that this age is adorned with some men of that strength of judgment and largeness of comprehension that if they would employ their thoughts on this subject could open new and undiscovered ways to the advancement of knowledge 8 we can reason about particulars and the immediate object of all our reasonings is nothing but particular ideas having here had occasion to speak of syllogism in general and,JohnLocke,,
471,11 iii thirdly because we perceive not intermediate ideas to show conclusions our reason is often at a stand because it perceives not those ideas which could serve to show the certain or probable agreement or disagreement of any other two ideas and in this some mens faculties far outgo others till algebra that great instrument and instance of human sagacity was discovered men with amazement looked on several of the demonstrations of ancient mathematicians and could scarce forbear to think the finding several of those proofs to be something more than human 12 iv fourthly because we often proceed upon wrong principles the mind by proceeding upon false principles is often engaged in absurdities and difficulties brought into straits and contradictions without knowing how to free itself and in that case it is in vain to implore the help of reason unless it be to discover the falsehood and reject,JohnLocke,,
472,no use of the discursive faculty no need of reasoning but they are known by a superior and higher degree of evidence and such if i may guess at things unknown i am apt to think that angels have now and the spirits of just men made perfect shall have in a future state of thousands of things which now either wholly escape our apprehensions or which our shortsighted reason having got some faint glimpse of we in the dark grope after 15 the next is got by reasoning but though we have here and there a little of this clear light some sparks of bright knowledge yet the greatest part of our ideas are such that we cannot discern their agreement or disagreement by an immediate comparing them and in all these we have need of reasoning and must by discourse and inference make our discoveries now of these there,JohnLocke,,
473,to go over them again and there is need of more than one review before they can arrive at certainty but yet where the mind clearly retains the intuition it had of the agreement of any idea with another and that with a third and that with a fourth c there the agreement of the first and the fourth is a demonstration and produces certain knowledge which may be called rational knowledge as the other is intuitive 16 secondly to supply the narrowness of demonstrative and intuitive knowledge we have nothing but judgment upon probable reasoning secondly there are other ideas whose agreement or disagreement can no otherwise be judged of but by the intervention of others which have not a certain agreement with the extremes but an usual or likely one and in these is that the judgment is properly exercised which is the acquiescing of the mind that any,JohnLocke,,
474,of it yet sometimes the intermediate ideas tie the extremes so firmly together and the probability is so clear and strong that assent as necessarily follows it as knowledge does demonstration the great excellency and use of the judgment is to observe right and take a true estimate of the force and weight of each probability and then casting them up all right together choose that side which has the overbalance 17 intuition demonstration judgment intuitive knowledge is the perception of the certain agreement or disagreement of two ideas immediately compared together rational knowledge is the perception of the certain agreement or disagreement of any two ideas by the intervention of one or more other ideas judgment is the thinking or taking two ideas to agree or disagree by the intervention of one or more ideas whose certain agreement or disagreement with them it does not perceive but hath observed to,JohnLocke,,
475,way because he has shown me that i am in the wrong i may be modest and therefore not oppose another mans persuasion i may be ignorant and not be able to produce a better i may be in an error and another may show me that i am so this may dispose me perhaps for the reception of truth but helps me not to it that must come from proofs and arguments and light arising from the nature of things themselves and not from my shamefacedness ignorance or error 23 above contrary and according to reason by what has been before said of reason we may be able to make some guess at the distinction of things into those that are according to above and contrary to reason 1 according to reason are such propositions whose truth we can discover by examining and tracing those ideas we have from sensation,JohnLocke,,
476,search and follow the clearer evidence and greater probability but since reason and faith are by some men opposed we will so consider them in the following chapter chapter xviii of faith and reason and their distinct provinces 1 necessary to know their boundaries it has been above shown 1 that we are of necessity ignorant and want knowledge of all sorts where we want ideas 2 that we are ignorant and want rational knowledge where we want proofs 3 that we want certain knowledge and certainty as far as we want clear and determined specific ideas 4 that we want probability to direct our assent in matters where we have neither knowledge of our own nor testimony of other men to bottom our reason upon from these things thus premised i think we may come to lay down the measures and boundaries between faith and reason the want whereof may,JohnLocke,,
477,in the minds of other men those ideas imprinted by that sixth sense than one of us could convey the idea of any colour by the sound of words into a man who having the other four senses perfect had always totally wanted the fifth of seeing for our simple ideas then which are the foundation and sole matter of all our notions and knowledge we must depend wholly on our reason i mean our natural faculties and can by no means receive them or any of them from traditional revelation i say traditional revelation in distinction to original revelation by the one i mean that first impression which is made immediately by god on the mind of any man to which we cannot set any bounds and by the other those impressions delivered over to others in words and the ordinary ways of conveying our conceptions one to another 4,JohnLocke,,
478,no greater an assurance than that of his senses that it is writ in the book supposed writ by inspired but he has not so great an assurance that wrote that book as if he had seen moses write it so that the assurance of its being a revelation is less still than the assurance of his senses 5 even original revelation cannot be admitted against the clear evidence of reason in propositions then whose certainty is built upon the clear perception of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas attained either by immediate intuition as in selfevident propositions or by evident deductions of reason in demonstrations we need not the assistance of revelation as necessary to gain our assent and introduce them into our minds because the natural ways of knowledge could settle them there or had done it already which is the greatest assurance we can possibly have of,JohnLocke,,
479,can never have a clearer and perhaps not so clear evidence of anything to be a divine revelation as it has of the principles of its own reason it can never have a ground to quit the clear evidence of its reason to give a place to a proposition whose revelation has not a greater evidence than those principles have 6 traditional revelation much less thus far a man has use of reason and ought to hearken to it even in immediate and original revelation where it is supposed to be made to himself but to all those who pretend not to immediate revelation but are required to pay obedience and to receive the truths revealed to others which by the tradition of writings or word of mouth are conveyed down to them reason has a great deal more to do and is that only which can induce us to receive,JohnLocke,,
480,for reason ever to procure any assent to that which to itself appears unreasonable in all things therefore where we have clear evidence from our ideas and those principles of knowledge i have above mentioned reason is the proper judge and revelation though it may in consenting with it confirm its dictates yet cannot in such cases invalidate its decrees nor can we be obliged where we have the clear and evident sentence of reason to quit it for the contrary opinion under a pretence that it is matter of faith which can have no authority against the plain and clear dictates of reason 7 thirdly things above reason are when revealed the proper matter of faith but thirdly there being many things wherein we have very imperfect notions or none at all and other things of whose past present or future existence by the natural use of our faculties we,JohnLocke,,
481,discovery of reason are purely matters of faith with which reason has directly nothing to do 8 or not contrary to reason if revealed are and must carry it against probable conjectures of reason but since god in giving us the light of reason has not thereby tied up his own hands from affording us when he thinks fit the light of revelation in any of those matters wherein our natural faculties are able to give a probable determination revelation where god has been pleased to give it must carry it against the probable conjectures of reason because the mind not being certain of the truth of that it does not evidently know but only yielding to the probability that appears in it is bound to give up its assent to such a testimony which it is satisfied comes from one who cannot err and will not deceive but yet it,JohnLocke,,
482,it without examination as a matter of faith 9 revelation in matters where reason cannot judge or but probably ought to be hearkened to first whatever proposition is revealed of whose truth our mind by its natural faculties and notions cannot judge that is purely matter of faith and above reason secondly all propositions whereof the mind by the use of its natural faculties can come to determine and judge from naturally acquired ideas are matter of reason with this difference still that in those concerning which it has but an uncertain evidence and so is persuaded of their truth only upon probable grounds which still admit a possibility of the contrary to be true without doing violence to the certain evidence of its own knowledge and overturning the principles of all reason in such probable propositions i say an evident revelation ought to determine our assent even against probability for,JohnLocke,,

484,men are judged of the greatest moment or to find out grounds of assurance so great as the belief of the points he would build on them is thought necessary so that a great part of mankind are by the natural and unalterable state of things in this world and the constitution of human affairs unavoidably given over to invincible ignorance of those proofs on which others build and which are necessary to establish those opinions the greatest part of men having much to do to get the means of living are not in a condition to look after those of learned and laborious inquiries 3 objection what shall become of those who want proofs answered what shall we say then are the greatest part of mankind by the necessity of their condition subjected to unavoidable ignorance in those things which are of greatest importance to them for of those it,JohnLocke,,
485,care is taken to propagate truth without knowledge where men are forced at a venture to be of the religion of the country and must therefore swallow down opinions as silly people do empirics pills without knowing what they are made of or how they will work and having nothing to do but believe that they will do the cure but in this are much more miserable than they in that they are not at liberty to refuse swallowing what perhaps they had rather let alone or to choose the physician to whose conduct they would trust themselves 5 of skill to use proofs secondly those who want skill to use those evidences they have of probabilities who cannot carry a train of consequences in their heads nor weigh exactly the preponderancy of contrary proofs and testimonies making every circumstance its due allowance may be easily misled to assent to positions,JohnLocke,,
486,third cause of error want of will to use them thirdly there are another sort of people that want proofs not because they are out of their reach but because they will not use them who though they have riches and leisure enough and want neither parts nor learning may yet through their hot pursuit of pleasure or business or else out of laziness or fear that the doctrines whose truth they would inquire into would not suit well with their opinions lives or designs may never come to the knowledge of nor give their assent to those possibilities which lie so much within their view that to be convinced of them they need but turn their eyes that way we know some men will not read a letter which is supposed to bring ill news and many men forbear to cast up their accounts or so much as think upon,JohnLocke,,
487,they offer to vouch anything contrary to these established rules how much the doctrine of innate principles and that principles are not to be proved or questioned has contributed to this i will not here examine this i readily grant that one truth cannot contradict another but withal i take leave also to say that every one ought very carefully to beware what he admits for a principle to examine it strictly and see whether he certainly knows it to be true of itself by its own evidence or whether he does only with assurance believe it to be so upon the authority of others for he hath a strong bias put into his understanding which will unavoidably misguide his assent who hath imbibed wrong principles and has blindly given himself up to the authority of any opinion in itself not evidently true 9 instilled in childhood there is nothing more,JohnLocke,,
488,against his senses let an enthusiast be principled that he or his teacher is inspired and acted by an immediate communication of the and you in vain bring the evidence of clear reasons against his doctrine whoever therefore have imbibed wrong principles are not in things inconsistent with these principles to be moved by the most apparent and convincing probabilities till they are so candid and ingenuous to themselves as to be persuaded to examine even those very principles which many never suffer themselves to do 11 received hypotheses next to these are men whose understandings are cast into a mould and fashioned just to the size of a received hypothesis the difference between these and the former is that they will admit of matter of fact and agree with dissenters in that but differ only in assigning of reasons and explaining the manner of operation these are not at that,JohnLocke,,
489,this of wrong hypothesis may be reduced the errors that may be occasioned by a true hypothesis or right principles but not rightly understood there is nothing more familiar than this the instances of men contending for different opinions which they all derive from the infallible truth of the scripture are an undeniable proof of it all that call themselves christians allow the text that saysword in greek to carry in it the obligation to a very weighty duty but yet how very erroneous will one of their practices be who understanding nothing but the french take this rule with one translation to be repentezvous repent or with the other fatiez penitence do penance 12 iii predominant passions probabilities which cross mens appetites and prevailing passions run the same fate let ever so much probability hang on one side of a covetous mans reasoning and money on the other it is,JohnLocke,,
490,that i think we may conclude that in propositions where though the proofs in view are of most moment yet there are sufficient grounds to suspect that there is either fallacy in words or certain proofs as considerable to be produced on the contrary side there assent suspense or dissent are often voluntary actions but where the proofs are such as make it highly probable and there is not sufficient ground to suspect that there is either fallacy of words which sober and serious consideration may discover nor equally valid proofs yet undiscovered latent on the other side which also the nature of the thing may in some cases make plain to a considerate man there i think a man who has weighed them can scarce refuse his assent to the side on which the greater probability appears whether it be probable that a promiscuous jumble of printing letters should often,JohnLocke,,
491,last wrong measure of probability i shall take notice of and which keeps in ignorance or error more people than all the other together is that which i have mentioned in the foregoing chapter i mean the giving up our assent to the common received opinions either of our friends or party neighbourhood or country how many men have no other ground for their tenets than the supposed honesty or learning or number of those of the same profession as if honest or bookish men could not err or truth were to be established by the vote of the multitude yet this with most men serves the turn the tenet has had the attestation of reverend antiquity it comes to me with the passport of former ages and therefore i am secure in the reception i give it other men have been and are of the same opinion for that is,JohnLocke,,

1423,men because liberty virtue and humanity were sacrificed to pleasure and vanity fatal passions which have ever domineered over the whole race the same love of pleasure fostered by the whole tendency of their education gives a trifling turn to the conduct of women in most circumstances for instance they are ever anxious about secondary things and on the watch for adventures instead of being occupied by duties a man when he undertakes a journey has in general the end in view a woman thinks more of the incidental occurrences the strange things that may possibly occur on the road the impression that she may make on her fellow travellers and above all she is anxiously intent on the care of the finery that she carries with her which is more than ever a part of herself when going to figure on a new scene when to use an apt french,MaryWollstonecraft,,

1549,some unaccountable bias in favour of beauty he was the husband of a very silly womanbut she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it it was rather a wish of distinction she believed which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body and his general abuse of every thing before him it was the desire of appearing superior to other people the motive was too common to be wondered at but the means however they might succeed by establishing his superiority in illbreeding were not likely to attach any one to him except his wife oh my dear miss said soon afterwards i have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister will you come and spend some time at this christmas now pray doand come while the westons are with us you cannot think how happy,JaneAustin,,
1550,been in the country together he is very little at combe i believe but if he were ever so much there i do not think mr would visit him for he is in the opposition you know and besides it is such a way off i know why you inquire about him very well your sister is to marry him i am monstrous glad of it for then i shall have her for a neighbour you know upon my word replied you know much more of the matter than i do if you have any reason to expect such a match dont pretend to deny it because you know it is what every body talks of i assure you i heard of it in my way through town my dear upon my honour i didi met colonel brandon in bondstreet just before we left town and he told me of it,JaneAustin,,
1551,i said to him so colonel there is a new family come to cottage i hear and mama sends me word they are very pretty and that one of them is going to be married to of is it true pray for of course you must know as you have been in so lately and what did the colonel say ohhe did not say much but he looked as if he knew it to be true so from that moment i set it down as certain it will be quite delightful i declare when is it to take place mr was very well i hope oh yes quite well and so full of your praises he did nothing but say fine things of you i am flattered by his commendation he seems an excellent man and i think him uncommonly pleasing so do ihe is such a charming man that it,JaneAustin,,
1552,think him extremely agreeable i assure you nobody is more liked than wherever he goes and so you may tell your sister she is a monstrous lucky girl to get him upon my honour not but that he is much more lucky in getting her because she is so very handsome and agreeable that nothing can be good enough for her however i dont think her hardly at all handsomer than you i assure you for i think you both excessively pretty and so does mr too i am sure though we could not get him to own it information respecting was not very material but any testimony in his favour however small was pleasing to her i am so glad we are got acquainted at last continued charlotteand now i hope we shall always be great friends you cant think how much i longed to see you it is so,JaneAustin,,
1553,admiration sir confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the miss dashwoods of the arrival and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls in the world from such commendation as this however there was not much to be learned well knew that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of under every possible variation of form face temper and understanding sir wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly and look at his guests benevolent philanthropic man it was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself do come now said hepray comeyou must comei declare you shall comeyou cant think how you will like them lucy is monstrous pretty and so good humoured and agreeable the children are all hanging about her already,JaneAustin,,
1554,by the other with such a reward for her tears the child was too wise to cease crying she still screamed and sobbed lustily kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her and all their united soothings were ineffectual till lady luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected she was carried out of the room therefore in her mothers arms in quest of this medicine and as the two boys chose to follow though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours poor,JaneAustin,,
1555,they were gone it might have been a very sad accident yet i hardly know how cried unless it had been under totally different circumstances but this is the usual way of heightening alarm where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality what a sweet woman lady is said was silent it was impossible for her to say what she did not feel however trivial the occasion and upon therefore the whole task of telling lies when politeness required it always fell she did her best when thus called on by speaking of lady with more warmth than she felt though with far less than miss lucy and sir too cried the elder sister what a charming man he is here too miss dashwoods commendation being only simple and just came in without any eclat she merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly and what a,JaneAustin,,
1556,sir admire it excessively said who seemed to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister i think every one must admire it replied who ever saw the place though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do and had you a great many smart beaux there i suppose you have not so many in this part of the world for my part i think they are a vast addition always but why should you think said looking ashamed of her sister that there are not as many genteel young men in as my dear im sure i dont pretend to say that there ant im sure theres a vast many smart beaux in but you know how could i tell what smart beaux there might be about and i was only afraid the might find it dull at if they,JaneAustin,,
1557,its a great secret repeated is the happy man is he what your sisterinlaws brother miss dashwood a very agreeable young man to be sure i know him very well how can you say so cried lucy who generally made an amendment to all her sisters assertions though we have seen him once or twice at my uncles it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well elinor heard all this with attention and surprise and who was this uncle where did he live how came they acquainted she wished very much to have the subject continued though she did not chuse to join in it herself but nothing more of it was said and for the first time in her life she thought deficient either in curiosity after petty information or in a disposition to communicate it the manner in which miss had spoken of edward increased,JaneAustin,,
1558,nothing of her i am sure you think me very strange for enquiring about her in such a way said eyeing attentively as she spoke but perhaps there may be reasonsi wish i might venture but however i hope you will do me the justice of believing that i do not mean to be impertinent made her a civil reply and they walked on for a few minutes in silence it was broken by who renewed the subject again by saying with some hesitation i cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious i am sure i would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours and i am sure i should not have the smallest fear of trusting you indeed i should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such,JaneAustin,,
1559,as it was strong had not an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it she turned towards in silent amazement unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration and though her complexion varied she stood firm in incredulity and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit or a swoon you may well be surprised continued lucy for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before for i dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family because it was always meant to be a great secret and i am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour not a soul of all my relations know of it but and i never should have mentioned it to you if i had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy and,JaneAustin,,
1560,when he knows i have trusted you because i know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family and looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite as his own sistersshe paused for a few moments remained silent her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words but at length forcing herself to speak and to speak cautiously she said with calmness of manner which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude i ask if your engagement is of long standing we have been engaged these four years four years yes though greatly shocked still felt unable to believe it i did not know said she that you were even acquainted till the other day our acquaintance however is of many years date he was under my uncles care you know a considerable while your uncle yes mr did you never hear,JaneAustin,,
1561,making such particular inquiries about mother and i am so unfortunate that i have not a creature whose advice i can ask is the only person that knows of it and she has no judgment at all indeed she does me a great deal more harm than good for i am in constant fear of her betraying me she does not know how to hold her tongue as you must perceive and i am sure i was in the greatest fright in the world tother day when name was mentioned by sir lest she should out with it all you cant think how much i go through in my mind from it altogether i only wonder that i am alive after what i have suffered for sake these last four years every thing in such suspense and uncertainty and seeing him so seldomwe can hardly meet above twice ayear i am,JaneAustin,,
1562,directly at her companion but then at other times i have not resolution enough for it i cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable as i know the very mention of such a thing would do and on my own account tooso dear as he is to mei dont think i could be equal to it what would you advise me to do in such a case miss dashwood what would you do yourself pardon me replied startled by the question but i can give you no advice under such circumstances your own judgment must direct you to be sure continued lucy after a few minutes silence on both sides his mother must provide for him sometime or other but poor is so cast down by it did you not think him dreadful lowspirited when he was at he was so miserable when he left us at longstaple to,JaneAustin,,
1563,necessary and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings that her success was speedy and for the time complete writing to each other said returning the letter into her pocket is the only comfort we have in such long separations yes i have one other comfort in his picture but poor has not even that if he had but my picture he says he should be easy i gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at longstaple last and that was some comfort to him he said but not equal to a picture perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him i did said with a composure of voice under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before she was mortified shocked confounded fortunately for her they had now reached the cottage,JaneAustin,,
1564,the rest at once indisputable and alarming and visit near his melancholy state of mind his dissatisfaction at his own prospects his uncertain behaviour towards herself the intimate knowledge of the as to and their family connections which had often surprised her the picture the letter the ring formed altogether such a body of evidence as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly and established as a fact which no partiality could set aside his illtreatment of herselfher resentment of such behaviour her indignation at having been its dupe for a short time made her feel only for herself but other ideas other considerations soon arose had edward been intentionally deceiving her had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel was his engagement to lucy an engagement of the heart no whatever it might once have been she could not believe it such at present his affection,JaneAustin,,
1565,a secret so confessedly and evidently important and even sir johns joking intelligence must have had some weight but indeed while remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that lucy should be jealous and that she was so her very confidence was a proof what other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be but that might be informed by it of lucys superior claims on and be taught to avoid him in future she had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rivals intentions and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed to combat her own affection for and to see him as little as possible she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince lucy that her heart was,JaneAustin,,
1566,at it for it is the very best toned pianoforte i ever heard the remaining five were now to draw their cards perhaps continued if i should happen to cut out i may be of some use to miss in rolling her papers for her and there is so much still to be done to the basket that it must be impossible i think for her labour singly to finish it this evening i should like the work exceedingly if she would allow me a share in it indeed i shall be very much obliged to you for your help cried lucy for i find there is more to be done to it than i thought there was and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear after all oh that would be terrible indeed said dear little soul how i do love her you are very kind said to,JaneAustin,,
1567,very glad to find it was only my own fancy and that you really do not blame me if you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what i am always thinking of every moment of my life your compassion would make you overlook every thing else i am sure indeed i can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you to acknowledge your situation to me and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it your case is a very unfortunate one you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them mr i believe is entirely dependent on his mother he has only two thousand pounds of his own it would be madness to marry upon that though for my,JaneAustin,,
1568,have seen enough of edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can and then through your interest which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him and i hope out of some regard to me your brother might be persuaded to give him living which i understand is a very good one and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while that would be enough for us to marry upon and we might trust to time and chance for the rest i should always be happy replied to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for mr but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary he is brother to mrs must be recommendation enough,JaneAustin,,
1569,that your judgment might justly have such weight with me if you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings your opinion would not be worth having thought it wisest to make no answer to this lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve and was even partly determined never to mention the subject again another pause therefore of many minutes duration succeeded this speech and was still the first to end it shall you be in town miss said she with all her accustomary complacency certainly not i am sorry for that returned the other while her eyes brightened at the information it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there but i dare say you will go for all that to be sure your brother and sister will ask you to come to them it will,JaneAustin,,
1570,the subject was never revived by and when entered on by who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it and was particularly careful to inform her confidante of her happiness whenever she received a letter from it was treated by the former with calmness and caution and dismissed as soon as civility would allow for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which did not deserve and which were dangerous to herself the visit of the at was lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied their favour increased they could not be spared sir would not hear of their going and in spite of their numerous and long arranged engagements in in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately which was in full force at the end of every week they were prevailed on to stay nearly two months at the park and to assist,JaneAustin,,
1571,going to that fastidious as she was thoroughly acquainted with manners and invariably disgusted by them should overlook every inconvenience of that kind should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings in her pursuit of one object was such a proof so strong so full of the importance of that object to her as elinor in spite of all that had passed was not prepared to witness on being informed of the invitation persuaded that such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her daughters and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to herself how much the heart of was in it would not hear of their declining the offer upon her account insisted on their both accepting it directly and then began to foresee with her usual cheerfulness a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all from this separation i am delighted,JaneAustin,,
1572,very much and shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest of the family it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether i am ever known to them or not smiled and said nothing lifted up her eyes in astonishment and conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue after very little farther discourse it was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted received the information with a great deal of joy and many assurances of kindness and care nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her sir was delighted for to a man whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of being alone the acquisition of two to the number of inhabitants in was something even lady took the trouble of being delighted which was putting herself rather out of her way and as for the miss steeles especially,JaneAustin,,

1574,ensured his welcome with her and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him she instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him that he even observed as she quitted the room with such astonishment and concern as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself is your sister ill said he elinor answered in some distress that she was and then talked of headaches low spirits and over fatigues and of every thing to which she could decently attribute her sisters behaviour he heard her with the most earnest attention but seeming to recollect himself said no more on the subject and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in making the usual inquiries about their journey and the friends they had left behind in this,JaneAustin,,

1576,with them the former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements and was obliged to assist in making a whist table for the others was of no use on these occasions as she would never learn the game but though her time was therefore at her own disposal the was by no means more productive of pleasure to her than to for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the pain of disappointment she sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read but the book was soon thrown aside and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window in hopes of distinguishing the longexpected rap chapter 27 if this open weather holds much longer said when they met at breakfast the following morning sir will not like leaving,JaneAustin,,

1916,we bid each other goodbye i want at least to thank you for having once thought of me as you did the touch of her hand the moving softness of her look thrilled a vulnerable fibre in it was her exquisite inaccessibleness the sense of distance she could convey without a hint of disdain that made it most difficult for him to give her up why do you talk of saying goodbye aint we going to be good friends all the same he urged without releasing her hand she drew it away quietly what is your idea of being good friends she returned with a slight smile making love to me without asking me to marry you laughed with a recovered sense of ease well thats about the size of it i suppose i cant help making love to youi dont see how any man could but i dont mean to,EdithWharton,,

1925,to feel her very hearts blood passing into her friend the sacrifice she had made had seemed unavailing enough no trace remained in lily of the subduing influences of that hour but gertys tenderness disciplined by long years of contact with obscure and inarticulate suffering could wait on its object with a silent forbearance which took no account of time she could not however deny herself the solace of taking anxious counsel with with whom since his return from she had renewed her old relation of cousinly confidence himself had never been aware of any change in their relation he found as he had left her simple undemanding and devoted but with a quickened intelligence of the heart which he recognized without seeking to explain it to gerty herself it would once have seemed impossible that she should ever again talk freely with him of but what had passed in the,EdithWharton,,

1927,her eyes made him add as he rose to take leave still ill do what you wish and not hold you responsible for my failure seldens avoidance of miss had not been as unintentional as he had allowed his cousin to think at first indeed while the memory of their last hour at still held the full heat of his indignation he had anxiously watched for her return but she had disappointed him by lingering in and when she finally reappeared it happened that business had called him to the west whence he came back only to learn that she was starting for with the gormers the revelation of this suddenlyestablished intimacy effectually chilled his desire to see her if at a moment when her whole life seemed to be breaking up she could cheerfully commit its reconstruction to the gormers there was no reason why such accidents should ever strike,EdithWharton,,

3521,who did washing rose went there to stay so that she might have the doctor from the hospital near by to help her have the baby and then too melanctha could attend to her while she was sick here the baby was born and here it died and then went back to her house again with had not made her life all simple like had not found it easy with herself to make her wants and what she had agree was always losing what she had in wanting all the things she saw melanctha was always being left when she was not leaving others always loved too hard and much too often she was always full with mystery and subtle movements and denials and vague distrusts and complicated disillusions then melanctha would be sudden and impulsive and unbounded in some faith and then she would suffer and be strong in her,GertrudeStein,female,early_modernism
3522,way even in the midst of her worst trouble to complain to any one of what happened to her but nevertheless somehow every one who knew melanctha always knew how much she suffered it was only while one really loved melanctha that one understood how to forgive her that she never once complained nor looked unhappy and was always handsome and in spirits and yet one always knew how much she suffered the father never told his troubles either and he was so fierce and serious that no one ever thought of asking as her neighbors called her was never heard even to speak of her husband or her daughter she was always pleasant sweetappearing mysterious and uncertain and a little wandering in her ways the herberts were a silent family with their troubles but somehow every one who knew them always knew everything that happened the morning of one day,GertrudeStein,female,early_modernism
3523,loved and wanted peace and gentleness and goodness and all her life for herself poor could only find new ways to be in trouble after and had drunk awhile together the good began to tell the father what a fine girl he had for a daughter perhaps the good had been drinking a good deal of liquor perhaps there was a gleam of something softer than the feeling of a friendly elder in the way then spoke of melanctha there had been a good deal of drinking and certainly that very morning had felt strongly melancthas power as a woman was always a fierce suspicious serious negro and drinking never made him feel more open he looked very black and evil as he sat and listened while grew more and more admiring as he talked half to himself half to the father of the virtues and the sweetness of melanctha suddenly,GertrudeStein,female,early_modernism
3524,little dimly and always she did not know what it was that really held her sometimes she would almost go over and then the strength in her of not really knowing would stop the average man in his endeavor it was a strange experience of ignorance and power and desire did not know what it was that she so badly wanted she was afraid and yet she did not understand that here she really was a coward boys had never meant much to melanctha they had always been too young to content her had a strong respect for any kind of successful power it was this that always kept melanctha nearer in her feeling toward her virile and unendurable black father than she ever was in her feeling for her pale yellow sweetappearing mother the things she had in her of her mother never made her feel respect in these young,GertrudeStein,female,early_modernism
