251,to what it is that names in the use of language are immediately applied secondly since all except proper names are general and so stand not particularly for this or that single thing but for sorts and ranks of things it will be necessary to consider in the next place what the sorts and kinds or if you rather like the latin names what the species and genera of things are wherein they consist and how they come to be made these being as they ought well looked into we shall the better come to find the right use of words the natural advantages and defects of language and the remedies that ought to be used to avoid the inconveniences of obscurity or uncertainty in the signification of words without which it is impossible to discourse with any clearness or order concerning knowledge which being conversant about propositions and those most,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

254,signification and why secondly that though the proper and immediate signification of words are ideas in the mind of the speaker yet because by familiar use from our cradles we come to learn certain articulate sounds very perfectly and have them readily on our tongues and always at hand in our memories but yet are not always careful to examine or settle their significations perfectly it often happens that men even when they would apply themselves to an attentive consideration do set their thoughts more on words than things nay because words are many of them learned before the ideas are known for which they stand therefore some not only children but men speak several words no otherwise than parrots do only because they have learned them and have been accustomed to those sounds but so far as words are of use and signification so far is there a constant connexion,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

256,i speak it this cannot be done by names applied to particular things whereof i alone having the ideas in my mind the names of them could not be significant or intelligible to another who was not acquainted with all those very particular things which had fallen under my notice 4 a distinct name for every particular thing not fitted for enlargement of knowledge thirdly but yet granting this also feasible which i think is not yet a distinct name for every particular thing would not be of any great use for the improvement of knowledge which though founded in particular things enlarges itself by general views to which things reduced into sorts under general names are properly subservient these with the names belonging to them come within some compass and do not multiply every moment beyond what either the mind can contain or use requires and therefore in these men,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
257,occasion to mention this or that particular horse when he is out of sight 6 how general words are made the next thing to be considered ishow general words come to be made for since all things that exist are only particulars how come we by general terms or where find we those general natures they are supposed to stand for words become general by being made the signs of general ideas and ideas become general by separating from them the circumstances of time and place and any other ideas that may determine them to this or that particular existence by this way of abstraction they are made capable of representing more individuals than one each of which having in it a conformity to that abstract idea is as we call it of that sort 7 shown by the way we enlarge our complex ideas from infancy but to deduce this,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
258,make such a noise in the schools and are with justice so little regarded out of them is nothing else but abstract ideas more or less comprehensive with names annexed to them in all which this is constant and unvariable that every more general term stands for such an idea and is but a part of any of those contained under it 10 why the genus is ordinarily made use of in definitions this may show us the reason why in the defining of words which is nothing but declaring their signification we make use of the genus or next general word that comprehends it which is not out of necessity but only to save the labour of enumerating the several simple ideas which the next general word or genus stands for or perhaps sometimes the shame of not being able to do it but though defining by genus and differentia,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
259,are the essences of genera and species the next thing therefore to be considered is what kind of signification it is that general words have for as it is evident that they do not signify barely one particular thing for then they would not be general terms but proper names so on the other side it is as evident they do not signify a plurality for man and men would then signify the same and the distinction of numbers as the grammarians call them would be superfluous and useless that then which general words signify is a sort of things and each of them does that by being a sign of an abstract idea in the mind to which idea as things existing are found to agree so they come to be ranked under that name or which is all one be of that sort whereby it is evident that the,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
260,is one and the same from whence it is easy to observe that the essences of the sorts of things and consequently the sorting of things is the workmanship of the understanding that abstracts and makes those general ideas 13 they are the workmanship of the understanding but have their foundation in the similitude of things i would not here be thought to forget much less to deny that in the production of things makes several of them alike there is nothing more obvious especially in the races of animals and all things propagated by seed but yet i think we may say the sorting of them under names is the workmanship of the understanding taking occasion from the similitude it observes amongst them to make abstract general ideas and set them up in the mind with names annexed to them as patterns or forms for in that sense the word,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
261,simple ideas which the understanding put together and then abstracting it affixed a name to it so that in truth every distinct abstract idea is a distinct essence and the names that stand for such distinct ideas are the names of things essentially different thus a circle is as essentially different from an oval as a sheep from a goat and rain is as essentially different from snow as water from earth that abstract idea which is the essence of one being impossible to be communicated to the other and thus any two abstract ideas that in any part vary one from another with two distinct names annexed to them constitute two distinct sorts or if you please species as essentially different as any two of the most remote or opposite in the world 15 several significations of the word essence but since the essences of things are thought by some,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
262,species the other and more rational opinion is of those who look on all natural things to have a real but unknown constitution of their insensible parts from which flow those sensible qualities which serve us to distinguish them one from another according as we have occasion to rank them into sorts under common denominations the former of these opinions which supposes these essences as a certain number of forms or moulds wherein all natural things that exist are cast and do equally partake has i imagine very much perplexed the knowledge of natural things the frequent productions of monsters in all the species of animals and of changelings and other strange issues of human birth carry with them difficulties not possible to consist with this hypothesis since it is as impossible that two things partaking exactly of the same real essence should have different properties as that two figures partaking,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
263,especially those things we are acquainted with and have ranked into bands under distinct names or ensigns thus that which was grass today is tomorrow the flesh of a sheep and within a few days after becomes part of a man in all which and the like changes it is evident their real essencei e that constitution whereon the properties of these several things dependedis destroyed and perishes with them but essences being taken for ideas established in the mind with names annexed to them they are supposed to remain steadily the same whatever mutations the particular substances are liable to for whatever becomes of alexander and bucephalus the ideas to which man and horse are annexed are supposed nevertheless to remain the same and so the essences of those species are preserved whole and undestroyed whatever changes happen to any or all of the individuals of those species by this,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
264,the essence of a mermaid is as intelligible as that of a man and the idea of an unicorn as certain steady and permanent as that of a horse from what has been said it is evident that the doctrine of the immutability of essences proves them to be only abstract ideas and is founded on the relation established between them and certain sounds as signs of them and will always be true as long as the same name can have the same signification 20 recapitulation to conclude this is that which in short i would say viz that all the great business of genera and species and their essences amounts to no more but thisthat men making abstract ideas and settling them in their minds with names annexed to them do thereby enable themselves to consider things and discourse of them as it were in bundles for the easier and,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
265,the names of simple ideas are not capable of any definition the names of all complex ideas are it has not that i know been yet observed by anybody what words are and what are not capable of being defined the want whereof is as i am apt to think not seldom the occasion of great wrangling and obscurity in mens discourses whilst some demand definitions of terms that cannot be defined and others think they ought not to rest satisfied in an explication made by a more general word and its restriction or to speak in terms of art by a genus and difference when even after such definition made according to rule those who hear it have often no more a clear conception of the meaning of the word than they had before this at least i think that the showing what words are and what are not capable,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
266,a dutchman ordinarily had in his mind and would signify to another when he used that sound 9 modern definition of motion nor have the modern philosophers who have endeavoured to throw off the jargon of the schools and speak intelligibly much better succeeded in defining simple ideas whether by explaining their causes or any otherwise the atomists who define motion to be a passage from one place to another what do they more than put one synonymous word for another for what is passage other than motion and if they were asked what passage was how would they better define it than by motion for is it not at least as proper and significant to say passage is a motion from one place to another as to say motion is a passage c this is to translate and not to define when we change two words of the same signification,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

314,by the application of other bodies will not think it strange that i count the properties of any sort of bodies not easy to be collected and completely known by the ways of inquiry which our faculties are capable of they being therefore at least so many that no man can know the precise and definite number they are differently discovered by different men according to their various skill attention and ways of handling who therefore cannot choose but have different ideas of the same substance and therefore make the signification of its common name very various and uncertain for the complex ideas of substances being made up of such simple ones as are supposed to coexist in nature every one has a right to put into his complex idea those qualities he has found to be united together for though in the substance of gold one satisfies himself with colour,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
315,that will truly and clearly follow from gold taken in such a signification but yet such as another man can never be forced to admit nor be convinced of their truth who makes not malleableness or the same degree of fixedness part of that complex idea that the name gold in his use of it stands for 16 instance liquor this is a natural and almost unavoidable imperfection in almost all the names of substances in all languages whatsoever which men will easily find when once passing from confused or loose notions they come to more strict and close inquiries for then they will be convinced how doubtful and obscure those words are in their signification which in ordinary use appeared very clear and determined i was once in a meeting of very learned and ingenious physicians where by chance there arose a question whether any liquor passed through the filaments,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

317,in general the least compounded ideas in every kind have the least dubious names 20 the most doubtful are the names of very compounded mixed modes and substances mixed modes therefore that are made up but of a few and obvious simple ideas have usually names of no very uncertain signification but the names of mixed modes which comprehend a great number of simple ideas are commonly of a very doubtful and undetermined meaning as has been shown the names of substances being annexed to ideas that are neither the real essences nor exact representations of the patterns they are referred to are liable to yet greater imperfection and uncertainty especially when we come to a philosophical use of them 21 why this imperfection charged upon words the great disorder that happens in our names of substances proceeding for the most part from our want of knowledge and inability to penetrate,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
318,we shall see in the following chapter but i am apt to imagine that were the imperfections of language as the instrument of knowledge more thoroughly weighed a great many of the controversies that make such a noise in the world would of themselves cease and the way to knowledge and perhaps peace too lie a great deal opener than it does 22 this should teach us moderation in imposing our own sense of old authors sure i am that the signification of words in all languages depending very much on the thoughts notions and ideas of him that uses them must unavoidably be of great uncertainty to men of the same language and country this is so evident in the greek authors that he that shall peruse their writings will find in almost every one of them a distinct language though the same words but when to this natural difficulty,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
319,than naturally they need to be 2 are often employed without any or without clear ideas first in this kind the first and most palpable abuse is the using of words without clear and distinct ideas or which is worse signs without anything signified of these there are two sorts i some words introduced without clear ideas annexed to them even in their first original one may observe in all languages certain words that if they be examined will be found in their first original and their appropriated use not to stand for any clear and distinct ideas these for the most part the several sects of philosophy and religion have introduced for their authors or promoters either affecting something singular and out of the way of common apprehensions or to support some strange opinions or cover some weakness of their hypothesis seldom fail to coin new words and such as,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
320,are annexed to that by an unpardonable negligence they familiarly use words which the propriety of language has affixed to very important ideas without any distinct meaning at all wisdom glory grace c are words frequent enough in every mans mouth but if a great many of those who use them should be asked what they mean by them they would be at a stand and not know what to answer a plain proof that though they have learned those sounds and have them ready at their tongues ends yet there are no determined ideas laid up in their minds which are to be expressed to others by them 4 this occasioned by men learning names before they have the ideas the names belong to men having been accustomed from their cradles to learn words which are easily got and retained before they knew or had framed the complex ideas to,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
321,people use as if their very sound necessarily carried with it constantly the same meaning this though men make a shift with in the ordinary occurrences of life where they find it necessary to be understood and therefore they make signs till they are so yet this insignificancy in their words when they come to reason concerning either their tenets or interest manifestly fills their discourse with abundance of empty unintelligible noise and jargon especially in moral matters where the words for the most part standing for arbitrary and numerous collections of ideas not regularly and permanently united in nature their bare sounds are often only thought on or at least very obscure and uncertain notions annexed to them men take the words they find in use amongst their neighbours and that they may not seem ignorant what they stand for use them confidently without much troubling their heads about a,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
322,upon which the argument turns used sometimes for one collection of simple ideas and sometimes for another which is a perfect abuse of language words being intended for signs of my ideas to make them known to others not by any natural signification but by a voluntary imposition it is plain cheat and abuse when i make them stand sometimes for one thing and sometimes for another the wilful doing whereof can be imputed to nothing but great folly or greater dishonesty and a man in his accounts with another may with as much fairness make the characters of numbers stand sometimes for one and sometimes for another collection of units vg this character 3 stand sometimes for three sometimes for four and sometimes for eight as in his discourse or reasoning make the same words stand for different collections of simple ideas if men should do so in their reckonings,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
323,extension of a body and yet there are those who find it necessary to confound their signification to this abuse and the mischiefs of confounding the signification of words logic and the liberal sciences as they have been handled in the schools have given reputation and the admired art of disputing hath added much to the natural imperfection of languages whilst it has been made use of and fitted to perplex the signification of words more than to discover the knowledge and truth of things and he that will look into that sort of learned writings will find the words there much more obscure uncertain and undetermined in their meaning than they are in ordinary conversation 7 logic and dispute have much contributed to this this is unavoidably to be so where mens parts and learning are estimated by their skill in disputing and if reputation and reward shall attend these,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
324,calling it subtlety this though a very useless skill and that which i think the direct opposite to the ways of knowledge hath yet passed hitherto under the laudable and esteemed names of subtlety and acuteness and has had the applause of the schools and encouragement of one part of the learned men of the world and no wonder since the philosophers of old the disputing and wrangling philosophers i mean such as wittily and with reason taxes and the since aiming at glory and esteem for their great and universal knowledge easier a great deal to be pretended to than really acquired found this a good expedient to cover their ignorance with a curious and inexplicable web of perplexed words and procure to themselves the admiration of others by unintelligible terms the apter to produce wonder because they could not be understood whilst it appears in all history that these,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
325,terms and holding them perpetually entangled in that endless labyrinth besides there is no such way to gain admittance or give defence to strange and absurd doctrines as to guard them round about with legions of obscure doubtful and undefined words which yet make these retreats more like the dens of robbers or holes of foxes than the fortresses of fair warriors which if it be hard to get them out of it is not for the strength that is in them but the briars and thorns and the obscurity of the thickets they are beset with for untruth being unacceptable to the mind of man there is no other defence left for absurdity but obscurity 10 but destroys the instruments of knowledge and communication thus learned ignorance and this art of keeping even inquisitive men from true knowledge hath been propagated in the world and hath much perplexed whilst it,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
326,niceties but obscurity and uncertainty leaving the words more unintelligible and the reader more at a loss how else comes it to pass that princes speaking or writing to their servants in their ordinary commands are easily understood speaking to their people in their laws are not so and as i remarked before doth it not often happen that a man of an ordinary capacity very well understands a text or a law that he reads till he consults an expositor or goes to counsel who by that time he hath done explaining them makes the words signify either nothing at all or what he pleases 13 and ought not to pass for learning whether any byinterests of these professions have occasioned this i will not here examine but i leave it to be considered whether it would not be well for mankind whose concernment it is to know things as,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
327,most important part of language and of all other the terms the most significant and should aerial and oetherial vehicles come once by the prevalency of that doctrine to be generally received anywhere no doubt those terms would make impressions on mens minds so as to establish them in the persuasion of the reality of such things as much as peripatetick forms and intentional species have heretofore done 15 instance in matter how much names taken for things are apt to mislead the understanding the attentive reading of philosophical writers would abundantly discover and that perhaps in words little suspected of any such misuse i shall instance in one only and that a very familiar one how many intricate disputes have there been about matter as if there were some such thing really in nature distinct from body as it is evident the word matter stands for an idea distinct from,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
328,one body is bigger than another but it sounds harsh and i think is never used to say one matter is bigger than another whence comes this then from hence that though matter and body be not really distinct but wherever there is the one there is the other yet matter and body stand for two different conceptions whereof the one is incomplete and but a part of the other for body stands for a solid extended figured substance whereof matter is but a partial and more confused conception it seeming to me to be used for the substance and solidity of body without taking in its extension and figure and therefore it is that speaking of matter we speak of it always as one because in truth it expressly contains nothing but the idea of a solid substance which is everywhere the same everywhere uniform this being our idea of,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
329,men would tell what ideas they make their words stand for there could not be half that obscurity or wrangling in the search or support of truth that there is 16 this makes errors lasting but whatever inconvenience follows from this mistake of words this i am sure that by constant and familiar use they charm men into notions far remote from the truth of things it would be a hard matter to persuade any one that the words which his father or schoolmaster the parson of the parish or such a reverend doctor used signified nothing that really existed in nature which perhaps is none of the least causes that men are so hardly drawn to quit their mistakes even in opinions purely philosophical and where they have no other interest but truth for the words they have a long time been used to remaining firm in their minds it,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
330,them into propositions and affirm or deny anything about them we do most commonly tacitly suppose or intend they should stand for the real essence of a certain sort of substances for when a man says gold is malleable he means and would insinuate something more than this that what i call gold is malleable though truly it amounts to no more but would have this understood viz that gold ie what has the real essence of gold is malleable which amounts to thus much that malleableness depends on and is inseparable from the real essence of gold but a man not knowing wherein that real essence consists the connexion in his mind of malleableness is not truly with an essence he knows not but only with the sound gold he puts for it thus when we say that animal rationale is and animal imflume bipes latis unguibus is not a,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
331,gold in name and about a parcel in the body itself vg a piece of leafgold laid before us though in discourse we are fain to substitute the name for the thing 20 the cause of this abuse a supposition of natures working always regularly in setting boundaries to species that which i think very much disposes men to substitute their names for the real essences of species is the supposition before mentioned that nature works regularly in the production of things and sets the boundaries to each of those species by giving exactly the same real internal constitution to each individual which we rank under one general name whereas any one who observes their different qualities can hardly doubt that many of the individuals called by the same name are in their internal constitution as different one from another as several of those which are ranked under different specific names,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
332,sixthly there remains yet another more general though perhaps less observed abuse of words and that is that men having by a long and familiar use annexed to them certain ideas they are apt to imagine so near and necessary a connexion between the names and signification they use them in that they forwardly suppose one cannot but understand what their meaning is and therefore one ought to acquiesce in the words delivered as if it were past doubt that in the use of those common received sounds the speaker and hearer had necessarily the same precise ideas whence presuming that when they have in discourse used any term they have thereby as it were set before others the very thing they talked of and so likewise taking the words of others as naturally standing for just what they themselves have been accustomed to apply them to they never trouble themselves,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
333,i know not what fault it can be to desire the explication of words whose sense seems dubious or why a man should be ashamed to own his ignorance in what sense another man uses his words since he has no other way of certainly knowing it but by being informed this abuse of taking words upon trust has nowhere spread so far nor with so ill effects as amongst men of letters the multiplication and obstinacy of disputes which have so laid waste the intellectual world is owing to nothing more than to this ill use of words for though it be generally believed that there is great diversity of opinions in the volumes and variety of controversies the world is distracted with yet the most i can find that the contending learned men of different parties do in their arguings one with another is that they speak different languages,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
334,too when we use them as signs of real beings which yet never had any reality or existence 26 how mens words fail in all these first when used without any ideas first he that hath words of any language without distinct ideas in his mind to which he applies them does so far as he uses them in discourse only make a noise without any sense or signification and how learned soever he may seem by the use of hard words or learned terms is not much more advanced thereby in knowledge than he would be in learning who had nothing in his study but the bare titles of books without possessing the contents of them for all such words however put into discourse according to the right construction of grammatical rules or the harmony of wellturned periods do yet amount to nothing but bare sounds and nothing else 27,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
335,his words loosely and unsteadily will either be not minded or not understood he that applies his names to ideas different from their common use wants propriety in his language and speaks gibberish and he that hath the ideas of substances disagreeing with the real existence of things so far wants the materials of true knowledge in his understanding and hath instead thereof chimeras 32 how mens words fail when they stand for substances in our notions concerning substances we are liable to all the former inconveniences v g he that uses the word tarantula without having any imagination or idea of what it stands for pronounces a good word but so long means nothing at all by it 2 he that in a newlydiscovered country shall see several sorts of animals and vegetables unknown to him before may have as true ideas of them as of a horse or a,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

340,to declare his meaning and make known what idea he makes it stand for this as has been shown cannot be done by definition and therefore when a synonymous word fails to do it there is but one of these ways left first sometimes the naming the subject wherein that simple idea is to be found will make its name to be understood by those who are acquainted with that subject and know it by that name so to make a countryman understand what feuillemorte colour signifies it may suffice to tell him it is the colour of withered leaves falling in autumn secondly but the only sure way of making known the signification of the name of any simple idea is by presenting to his senses that subject which may produce it in his mind and make him actually have the idea that word stands for 15 in mixed modes,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
341,to say no worse of it to refuse to do it since a definition is the only way whereby the precise meaning of moral words can be known and yet a way whereby their meaning may be known certainly and without leaving any room for any contest about it and therefore the negligence or perverseness of mankind cannot be excused if their discourses in morality be not much more clear than those in natural philosophy since they are about ideas in the mind which are none of them false or disproportionate they having no external beings for the archetypes which they are referred to and must correspond with it is far easier for men to frame in their minds an idea which shall be the standard to which they will give the name justice with which pattern so made all actions that agree shall pass under that denomination than having seen,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

344,constitution of substances as we have of a triangle and so perceive how all their properties and operations flow from thence but the manner how they come by that knowledge exceeds our conceptions 24 ideas of substances must also be conformable to things fourthly but though definitions will serve to explain the names of substances as they stand for our ideas yet they leave them not without great imperfection as they stand for things for our names of substances being not put barely for our ideas but being made use of ultimately to represent things and so are put in their place their signification must agree with the truth of things as well as with mens ideas and therefore in substances we are not always to rest in the ordinary complex idea commonly received as the signification of that word but must go a little further and inquire into the nature,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
345,of common words are certainly established and the precise ideas they stand for perfectly known and that it is a shame to be ignorant of them both which suppositions are false no names of complex ideas having so settled determined significations that they are constantly used for the same precise ideas nor is it a shame for a man to have a certain knowledge of anything but by the necessary ways of attaining it and so it is no discredit not to know what precise idea any sound stands for in another mans mind without he declare it to me by some other way than barely using that sound there being no other way without such a declaration certainly to know it indeed the necessity of communication by language brings men to an agreement in the signification of common words within some tolerable latitude that may serve for ordinary conversation and,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

351,not be amiss to consider a little the degrees of its evidence the different clearness of our knowledge seems to me to lie in the different way of perception the mind has of the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas for if we will reflect on our own ways of thinking we will find that sometimes the mind perceives the agreement or disagreement of two ideas immediately by themselves without the intervention of any other and this i think we may call intuitive knowledge for in this the mind is at no pains of proving or examining but perceives the truth as the eye doth light only by being directed towards it thus the mind perceives that white is not black that a circle is not a triangle that three are more than two and equal to one and two such kinds of truths the mind perceives at the,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
352,which the three angles of a triangle have an equality and finding those equal to two right ones comes to know their equality to two right ones 3 demonstration depends on clearly perceived proofs those intervening ideas which serve to show the agreement of any two others are called proofs and where the agreement and disagreement is by this means plainly and clearly perceived it is called demonstration it being shown to the understanding and the mind made to see that it is so a quickness in the mind to find out these intermediate ideas that shall discover the agreement or disagreement of any other and to apply them right is i suppose that which is called sagacity 4 as certain but not so easy and ready as intuitive knowledge this knowledge by intervening proofs though it be certain yet the evidence of it is not altogether so clear and bright,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

354,paper and so if the mind have the faculty of distinct perception it will perceive the agreement or disagreement of those ideas that produce intuitive knowledge if the eyes have lost the faculty of seeing or the mind of perceiving we in vain inquire after the quickness of sight in one or clearness of perception in the other 6 not so clear as intuitive knowledge it is true the perception produced by demonstration is also very clear yet it is often with a great abatement of that evident lustre and full assurance that always accompany that which i call intuitive like a face reflected by several mirrors one to another where as long as it retains the similitude and agreement with the object it produces a knowledge but it is still in every successive reflection with a lessening of that perfect clearness and distinctness which is in the first till at,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

362,being that of vision we must in many things content ourselves with faith and probability and in the present question about the immateriality of the soul if our faculties cannot arrive at demonstrative certainty we need not think it strange all the great ends of morality and religion are well enough secured without philosophical proofs of the souls immateriality since it is evident that he who made us at the beginning to subsist here sensible intelligent beings and for several years continued us in such a state can and will restore us to the like state of sensibility in another world and make us capable there to receive the retribution he has designed to men according to their doings in this life and therefore it is not of such mighty necessity to determine one way or the other as some overzealous for or against the immateriality of the soul have been,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

365,a very little way secondly as to the second sort which is the agreement or disagreement of our ideas in coexistence in this our knowledge is very short though in this consists the greatest and most material part of our knowledge concerning substances for our ideas of the species of substances being as i have showed nothing but certain collections of simple ideas united in one subject and so coexisting together vg our idea of flame is a body hot luminous and moving upward of gold a body heavy to a certain degree yellow malleable and fusible for these or some such complex ideas as these in mens minds do these two names of the different substances flame and gold stand for when we would know anything further concerning these or any other sort of substances what do we inquire but what other qualities or powers these substances have or have,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
366,with any other simple ideas whose coexistence with them we would inform ourselves about 11 especially of the secondary qualities of bodies the ideas that our complex ones of substances are made up of and about which our knowledge concerning substances is most employed are those of their secondary qualities which depending all as has been shown upon the primary qualities of their minute and insensible parts or if not upon them upon something yet more remote from our comprehension it is impossible we should know which have a necessary union or inconsistency one with another for not knowing the root they from not knowing what size figure and texture of parts they are on which depend and from which result those qualities which make our complex idea of gold it is impossible we should know what other qualities result from or are incompatible with the same constitution of the insensible,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

370,of the least change in the ideas this cannot be thus done in moral ideas we have no sensible marks that resemble them whereby we can set them down we have nothing but words to express them by which though when written they remain the same yet the ideas they stand for may change in the same man and it is very seldom that they are not different in different persons secondly another thing that makes the greater difficulty in ethics is that moral ideas are commonly more complex than those of the figures ordinarily considered in mathematics from whence these two inconveniences followfirst that their names are of more uncertain signification the precise collection of simple ideas they stand for not being so easily agreed on and so the sign that is used for them in communication always and in thinking often does not steadily carry with it the same,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

375,scientifical will still be out of our reach because we want perfect and adequate ideas of those very bodies which are nearest to us and most under our command those which we have ranked into classes under names and we think ourselves best acquainted with we have but very imperfect and incomplete ideas of distinct ideas of the several sorts of bodies that fall under the examination of our senses perhaps we may have but adequate ideas i suspect we have not of any one amongst them and though the former of these will serve us for common use and discourse yet whilst we want the latter we are not capable of scientifical knowledge nor shall ever be able to discover general instructive unquestionable truths concerning them certainty and demonstration are things we must not in these matters pretend to by the colour figure taste and smell and other sensible qualities,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

378,our bodies is as inconceivable how any thought should produce a motion in body is as remote from the nature of our ideas as how any body should produce any thought in the mind that it is so if experience did not convince us the consideration of the things themselves would never be able in the least to discover to us these and the like though they have a constant and regular connexion in the ordinary course of things yet that connexion being not discoverable in the ideas themselves which appearing to have no necessary dependence one on another we can attribute their connexion to nothing else but the arbitrary determination of that who has made them to be and to operate as they do in a way wholly above our weak understandings to conceive 29 instances in some of our ideas there are certain relations habitudes and connexions so visibly,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
379,want of finding out those intermediate ideas which may show us what habitude of agreement or disagreement they have one with another and thus many are ignorant of mathematical truths not out of any imperfection of their faculties or uncertainty in the things themselves but for want of application in acquiring examining and by due ways comparing those ideas that which has most contributed to hinder the due tracing of our ideas and finding out their relations and agreements or disagreements one with another has been i suppose the ill use of words it is impossible that men should ever truly seek or certainly discover the agreement or disagreement of ideas themselves whilst their thoughts flutter about or stick only in sounds of doubtful and uncertain significations mathematicians abstracting their thoughts from names and accustoming themselves to set before their minds the ideas themselves that they would consider and not sounds,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

382,it will be easily granted that the knowledge we have of mathematical truths is not only certain but real knowledge and not the bare empty vision of vain insignificant chimeras of the brain and yet if we will consider we shall find that it is only of our own ideas the mathematician considers the truth and properties belonging to a rectangle or circle only as they are in idea in his own mind for it is possible he never found either of them existing mathematically ie precisely true in his life but yet the knowledge he has of any truths or properties belonging to a circle or any other mathematical figure are nevertheless true and certain even of real things existing because real things are no further concerned nor intended to be meant by any such propositions than as things really agree to those archetypes in his mind is it true,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
383,who pretend to make it their business to inquire after truth and certainty will i presume upon examination be found to be general propositions and notions in which existence is not at all concerned all the discourses of the mathematicians about the squaring of a circle conic sections or any other part of mathematics concern not the existence of any of those figures but their demonstrations which depend on their ideas are the same whether there be any square or circle existing in the world or no in the same manner the truth and certainty of moral discourses abstracts from the lives of men and the existence of those virtues in the world whereof they treat nor are less true because there is nobody in the world that exactly practises his rules and lives up to that pattern of a virtuous man which he has given us and which existed nowhere,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
384,the idea under consideration from the sign that stands for it our knowledge goes equally on in the discovery of real truth and certainty whatever sounds we make use of 10 misnaming disturbs not the certainty of the knowledge one thing more we are to take notice of that where god or any other lawmaker hath defined any moral names there they have made the essence of that species to which that name belongs and there it is not safe to apply or use them otherwise but in other cases it is bare impropriety of speech to apply them contrary to the common usage of the country but yet even this too disturbs not the certainty of that knowledge which is still to be had by a due contemplation and comparing of those even nicknamed ideas 11 thirdly our complex ideas of substances have their archetypes without us and here knowledge,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
385,if we rightly consider and confine not our thoughts and abstract ideas to names as if there were or could be no other sorts of things than what known names had already determined and as it were set out we should think of things with greater freedom and less confusion than perhaps we do it would possibly be thought a bold paradox if not a very dangerous falsehood if i should say that some changelings who have lived forty years together without any appearance of reason are something between a man and a beast which prejudice is founded upon nothing else but a false supposition that these two names man and beast stand for distinct species so set out by real essences that there can come no other species between them whereas if we will abstract from those names and the supposition of such specific essences made by nature wherein all,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
386,is no more but an accidental difference between themselves and changelings the essence in both being exactly the same to consider whether they can imagine immortality annexed to any outward shape of the body the very proposing it is i suppose enough to make them disown it no one yet that ever i heard of how much soever immersed in matter allowed that excellency to any figure of the gross sensible outward consequence of it or that any mass of matter should after its dissolution here be again restored hereafter to an everlasting state of sense perception and knowledge only because it was moulded into this or that figure and had such a particular frame of its visible parts such an opinion as this placing immortality in a certain superficial figure turns out of doors all consideration of soul or spirit upon whose account alone some corporeal beings have hitherto been,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
387,in the common phrase the far more essential part not shall the want of a nose or a neck make a monster and put such issue out of the rank of men the want of reason and understanding not this is to bring all back again to what was exploded just now this is to place all in the shape and to take the measure of a man only by his outside to show that according to the ordinary way of reasoning in this matter people do lay the whole stress on the figure and resolve the whole essence of the species of man as they make it into the outward shape how unreasonable soever it be and how much soever they disown it we need but trace their thoughts and practice a little further and then it will plainly appear the wellshaped changeling is a man has a rational soul,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
388,begin to boggle make the face yet narrower flatter and longer and then you are at a stand add still more and more of the likeness of a brute to it and let the head be perfectly that of some other animal then presently it is a monster and it is demonstration with you that it hath no rational soul and must be destroyed where now i ask shall be the just measure which the utmost bounds of that shape that carries with it a rational soul for since there have been human foetuses produced half beast and half man and others three parts one and one part the other and so it is possible they may be in all the variety of approaches to the one or the other shape and may have several degrees of mixture of the likeness of a man or a brutei would gladly know what,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
389,the word monster signifies anything at all but something neither man nor beast but partaking somewhat of either and just so is the changeling before mentioned so necessary is it to quit the common notion of species and essences if we will truly look into the nature of things and examine them by what our faculties can discover in them as they exist and not by groundless fancies that have been taken up about them 17 words and species i have mentioned this here because i think we cannot be too cautious that words and species in the ordinary notions which we have been used to of them impose not on us for i am apt to think therein lies one great obstacle to our clear and distinct knowledge especially in reference to substances and from thence has rose a great part of the difficulties about truth and certainty would we,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
390,names but when we would consider or make propositions about the more complex ideas as of a man vitriol fortitude glory we usually put the name for the idea because the ideas these names stand for being for the most part imperfect confused and undetermined we reflect on the names themselves because they are more clear certain and distinct and readier occur to our thoughts than the pure ideas and so we make use of these words instead of the ideas themselves even when we would meditate and reason within ourselves and make tacit mental propositions in substances as has been already noticed this is occasioned by the imperfections of our ideas we making the name stand for the real essence of which we have no idea at all in modes it is occasioned by the great number of simple ideas that go to the making them up for many of,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
391,precise ideas the most of them stood for some confused or obscure notions have served their turns and many who talk very much of religion and conscience of church and faith of power and right of obstructions and humours melancholy and choler would perhaps have little left in their thoughts and meditations if one should desire them to think only of the things themselves and lay by those words with which they so often confound others and not seldom themselves also 5 mental and verbal propositions contrasted but to return to the consideration of truth we must i say observe two sorts of propositions that we are capable of making first mental wherein the ideas in our understandings are without the use of words put together or separated by the mind perceiving or judging of their agreement or disagreement secondly verbal propositions which are words the signs of our ideas put,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
392,of the idea of animal with that of is as clear and visable to the mind as the agreement of the idea of animal with that of man and so these two propositions are equally true equally certain but of what use is all such truth to us 8 answered real truth is about ideas agreeing to things though what has been said in the foregoing chapter to distinguish real from imaginary knowledge might suffice here in answer to this doubt to distinguish real truth from chimerical or if you please barely nominal they depending both on the same foundation yet it may not be amiss here again to consider that though our words signify things the truth they contain when put into propositions will be only verbal when they stand for ideas in the mind that have not an agreement with the reality of things and therefore truth as well,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
393,marked by those words 10 general propositions to be treated of more at large but because words are looked on as the great conduits of truth and knowledge and that in conveying and receiving of truth and commonly in reasoning about it we make use of words and propositions i shall more at large inquire wherein the certainty of real truths contained in propositions consists and where it is to be had and endeavour to show in what sort of universal propositions we are capable of being certain of their real truth or falsehood i shall begin with general propositions as those which most employ our thoughts and exercise our contemplation general truths are most looked after by the mind as those that most enlarge our knowledge and by their comprehensiveness satisfying us at once of many particulars enlarge our view and shorten our way to knowledge 11 moral and truth,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

395,more particularly concerns substances the names of substances then whenever made to stand for species which are supposed to be constituted by real essences which we know not are not capable to convey certainty to the understanding of the truth general propositions made up of such terms we cannot be sure the reason whereof is plain for how can we be sure that this or that quality is in gold when we know not what is or is not gold since in this way of speaking nothing is gold but what partakes of an essence which we not knowing cannot know where it is or is not and so cannot be sure that any parcel of matter in the world is or is not in this sense gold being incurably ignorant whether it has or has not that which makes anything to be called gold i e that real essence of,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

397,liquor and not in anotherif i say we had such an idea as this of bodies and could perceive wherein all sensible qualities originally consist and how they are produced we might frame such abstract ideas of them as would furnish us with matter of more general knowledge and enable us to make universal propositions that should carry general truth and certainty with them but whilst our complex ideas of the sorts of substances are so remote from that internal real constitution on which their sensible qualities depend and are made up of nothing but an imperfect collection of those apparent qualities our senses can discover there can be few general propositions concerning substances of whose real truth we can be certainly assured since there are but few simple ideas of whose connexion and necessary coexistence we can have certain and undoubted knowledge i imagine amongst all the secondary qualities of,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
398,ideas it is not to be wondered that we can with them make very few general propositions of undoubted real certainty but yet so far as any complex idea of any sort of substances contains in it any simple idea whose necessary coexistence with any other may be discovered so far universal propositions may with certainty be made concerning it vg could any one discover a necessary connexion between malleableness and the colour or weight of gold or any other part of the complex idea signified by that name he might make a certain universal proposition concerning gold in this respect and the real truth of this proposition that all gold is malliable would be as certain as of this the three angles of all rightlined triangles are all equal to two right ones 11 the qualities which make our complex ideas of substances depend mostly on external remote and unperceived,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

404,finds in those ideas answering the affirmation or negation in the proposition 3 self evidence not peculiar to received axioms this being so in the next place let us consider whether this selfevidence be peculiar only to those propositions which commonly pass under the name of maxims and have the dignity of axioms allowed them and here it is plain that several other truths not allowed to be axioms partake equally with them in this selfevidence this we shall see if we go over these several sorts of agreement or disagreement of ideas which i have above mentioned viz identity relation coexistence and real existence which will discover to us that not only those few propositions which have had the credit of maxims are selfevident but a great many even almost an infinite number of other propositions are such 4 as to identity and diversity all propositions are equally selfevident i,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
405,add nothing to the evidence or certainty of its knowledge just so it is as every one may experiment in himself in all the ideas a man has in his mind he knows each to be itself and not to be another and to be in his mind and not away when it is there with a certainty that cannot be greater and therefore the truth of no general proposition can be known with a greater certainty nor add anything to this so that in respect of identity our intuitive knowledge reaches as far as our ideas and we are capable of making as many selfevident propositions as we have names for distinct ideas and i appeal to every ones own mind whether this proposition a circle is a circle be not as selfevident a proposition as that consisting of more general terms whatsoever is is and again whether this proposition,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
406,these two things first that these axioms are those truths that are first known to the mind and secondly that upon them the other parts of our knowledge depend 9 because maxims or axioms are not the truths we first knew first that they are not the truths first known to the mind is evident to experience as we have shown in another place book i chap 1 who perceives not that a child certainly knows that a stranger is not its mother that its suckingbottle is not the rod long before he knows that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and how many truths are there about numbers which it is obvious to observe that the mind is perfectly acquainted with and fully convinced of before it ever thought on these general maxims to which mathematicians in their arguings do sometimes refer them,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
407,great many that we know before them it is impossible they should be the principles from which we deduce all other truths is it impossible to know that one and two are equal to three but by virtue of this or some such axiom viz the whole is equal to all its parts taken together many a one knows that one and two are equal to three without having heard or thought on that or any other axiom by which it might be proved and knows it as certainly as any other man knows that the whole is equal to all its parts or any other maxim and all from the same reason of selfevidence the equality of those ideas being as visible and certain to him without that or any other axiom as with it it needing no proof to make it perceived nor after the knowledge that the whole,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
408,innumerable which men arrive to the knowledge of at different ages and a great many of these innate principles they never come to know all their lives but whether they come in view of the mind earlier or later this is true of them that they are all known by their native evidence are wholly independent receive no light nor are capable of any proof one from another much less the more particular from the more general or the more simple from the more compounded the more simple and less abstract being the most familiar and the easier and earlier apprehended but whichever be the clearest ideas the evidence and certainty of all such propositions is in this that a man sees the same idea to be the same idea and infallibly perceives two different ideas to be different ideas for when a man has in his understanding the ideas of,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
409,that led him into the discovery of the truth and certainty of those propositions nor was it by them that he got the knowledge of those demonstrations but by finding out intermediate ideas that showed the agreement or disagreement of the ideas as expressed in the propositions he demonstrated this is the greatest exercise and improvement of human understanding in the enlarging of knowledge and advancing the sciences wherein they are far enough from receiving any help from the contemplation of these or the like magnified maxims would those who have this traditional admiration of these propositions that they think no step can be made in knowledge without the support of an axiom no stone laid in the building of the sciences without a general maxim but distinguish between the method of acquiring knowledge and of communicating it between the method of raising any science and that of teaching it to,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
410,schools which being such as all men allowed and agreed in were looked on as general measures of truth and served instead of principles where the disputants had not lain down any other between them beyond which there was no going and which must not be receded from by either side and thus these maxims getting the name of principles beyond which men in dispute could not retreat were by mistake taken to be the originals and sources from whence all knowledge began and the foundations whereon the sciences were built because when in their disputes they came to any of these they stopped there and went no further the matter was determined but how much this is a mistake hath been already shown how maxims came to be so much in vogue this method of the schools which have been thought the fountains of knowledge introduced as i suppose the,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
411,can they are only about identical predications and influence if any at all none but such each particular proposition concerning identity or diversity is as clearly and certainly known in itself if attended to as either of these general ones only these general ones as serving in all cases are therefore more inculcated and insisted on as to other less general maxims many of them are no more than bare verbal propositions and teach us nothing but the respect and import of names one to another the whole is equal to all its parts what real truth i beseech you does it teach us what more is contained in that maxim than what the signification of the word totum or the whole does of itself import and he that knows that the word whole stands for what is made up of all its parts knows very little less than that the,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
412,may also pass for maxims but yet masters of mathematics when they would as teachers of what they know initiate others in that science do not without reason place this and some other such maxims at the entrance of their systems that their scholars having in the beginning perfectly acquainted their thoughts with these propositions made in such general terms may be used to make such reflections and have these more general propositions as formed rules and sayings ready to apply to all particular cases not that if they be equally weighed they are more clear and evident than the particular instances they are brought to confirm but that being more familiar to the mind the very naming them is enough to satisfy the understanding but this i say is more from our custom of using them and the establishment they have got in our minds by our often thinking of,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
413,must remain broken and mysterious in the human understanding by which familiar use of them as rules to measure the truth of other propositions it comes in time to be thought that more particular propositions have their truth and evidence from their conformity to these more general ones which in discourse and argumentation are so frequently urged and constantly admitted and this i think to be the reason why amongst so many selfevident propositions the most general only have had the title of maxims 12 maxims if care be not taken in the use of words may prove contradictions one thing further i think it may not be amiss to observe concerning these general maxims that they are so far from improving or establishing our minds in true knowledge that if our notions be wrong loose or unsteady and we resign up our thoughts to the sound of words rather than,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
414,i have made this remark in all that is here suggested concerning their little use for the improvement of knowledge or dangerous use in undetermined ideas i have been far enough from saying or intending they should be laid aside as some have been too forward to charge me i affirm them to be truths selfevident truths and so cannot be laid aside as far as their influence will reach it is in vain to endeavour nor will i attempt to abridge it but yet without any injury to truth or knowledge i may have reason to think their use is not answerable to the great stress which seems to be laid on them and i may warn men not to make an ill use of them for the confirming themselves in errors 15 they cannot add to our knowledge of substances and their application to complex ideas is dangerous but,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

449,to disesteem or dissuade the study of nature i readily agree the contemplation of his works gives us occasion to admire revere and glorify their author and if rightly directed may be of greater benefit to mankind than the monuments of exemplary charity that have at so great charge been raised by the founders of hospitals and almshouses he that first invented printing discovered the use of the compass or made public the virtue and right use of did more for the propagation of knowledge for the supply and increase of useful commodities and saved more from the grave than those who built colleges workhouses and hospitals all that i would say is that we should not be too forwardly possessed with the opinion or expectation of knowledge where it is not to be had or by ways that will not attain to it that we should not take doubtful systems,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
450,use of any probable hypothesis whatsoever hypotheses if they are well made are at least great helps to the memory and often direct us to new discoveries but my meaning is that we should not take up any one too hastily which the mind that would always penetrate into the causes of things and have principles to rest on is very apt to do till we have very well examined particulars and made several experiments in that thing which we would explain by our hypothesis and see whether it will agree to them all whether our principles will carry us quite through and not be as inconsistent with one phenomenon of nature as they seem to accommodate and explain another and at least that we take care that the name of principles deceive us not nor impose on us by making us receive that for an unquestionable truth which is really,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

452,them and if they have any distinguishing faculty cannot but perceive the agreement or disagreement of some of them one with another as he that has eyes if he will open them by day cannot but see some objects and perceive a difference in them but though a man with his eyes open in the light cannot but see yet there be certain objects which he may choose whether he will turn his eyes to there may be in his reach a book containing pictures and discourses capable to delight or instruct him which yet he may never have the will to open never take the pains to look into 2 the application of our faculties voluntary but they being employed we know as things are not as we please there is also another thing in a mans power and that is though he turns his eyes sometimes towards an object,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
453,as that the sun shines when he sees it for if he hath but the ideas of two such beings in his mind and will turn his thoughts that way and consider them he will as certainly find that the inferior finite and dependent is under an obligation to obey the supreme and infinite as he is certain to find that three four and seven are less than fifteen if he will consider and compute those numbers nor can he be surer in a clear morning that the sun is risen if he will but open his eyes and turn them that way but yet these truths being ever so certain ever so clear he may be ignorant of either or all of them who will never take the pains to employ his faculties as he should to inform himself about them chapter xiv of judgment 1 our knowledge being short,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

455,the twilight as i may so say of probability suitable i presume to that state of mediocrity and probationership he has been pleased to place us in here wherein to check our overconfidence and presumption we might by every days experience be made sensible of our shortsightedness and liableness to error the sense whereof might be a constant admonition to us to spend the days of this our pilgrimage with industry and care in the search and following of that way which might lead us to a state of greater perfection it being highly rational to think even were revelation silent in the case that as men employ those talents god has given them here they shall accordingly receive their rewards at the close of the day when their sun shall set and night shall put an end to their labours 3 judgement or assent to probability supplies our want of,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
456,the probability of the thing the proof being such as for the most part carries truth with it the man on whose testimony he receives it not being wont to affirm anything contrary to or besides his knowledge especially in matters of this kind so that that which causes his assent to this proposition that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones that which makes him take these ideas to agree without knowings them to do so is the wonted veracity of the speaker in other cases or his supposed veracity in this 2 it is to supply our want of knowledge our knowledge as has been shown being very narrow and we not happy enough to find certain truth in everything which we have occasion to consider most of the propositions we think reason discoursenay act upon are such as we cannot have undoubted knowledge,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
457,ought to be examined before we come to a judgment probability wanting that intuitive evidence which infallibly determines the understanding and produces certain knowledge the mind if it will proceed rationally ought to examine all the grounds of probability and see how they make more or less for or against any proposition before it assents to or dissents from it and upon a due balancing the whole reject or receive it with a more or less firm assent proportionably to the preponderancy of the greater grounds of probability on one side or the other for example if i myself see a man walk on the ice it is past probability it is knowledge but if another tells me he saw a man in in the midst of a sharp winter walk upon water hardened with cold this has so great conformity with what is usually observed to happen that i am,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
458,proposition and as the conformity of our knowledge as the certainty of observations as the frequency and constancy of experience and the number and credibility of testimonies do more or less agree or disagree with it so is any proposition in itself more or less probable there is another i confess which though by itself it be no true ground of probability yet is often made use of for one by which men most commonly regulate their assent and upon which they pin their faith more than anything else and that is the opinion of others though there cannot be a more dangerous thing to rely on nor more likely to mislead one since there is much more falsehood and error among men than truth and knowledge and if the opinions and persuasions of others whom we know and think well of be a ground of assent men have reason to,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
459,in most very hard even for those who have very admirable memories to retain all the proofs which upon a due examination made them embrace that side of the question it suffices that they have once with care and fairness sifted the matter as far as they could and that they have searched into all the particulars that they could imagine to give any light to the question and with the best of their skill cast up the account upon the whole evidence and thus having once found on which side the probability appeared to them after as full and exact an inquiry as they can make they lay up the conclusion in their memories as a truth they have discovered and for the future they remain satisfied with the testimony of their memories that this is the opinion that by the proofs they have once seen of it deserves such,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
460,and forbearance in a necessary diversity of opinions since therefore it is unavoidable to the greatest part of men if not all to have several opinions without certain and indubitable proofs of their truth and it carries too great an imputation of ignorance lightness or folly for men to quit and renounce their former tenets presently upon the offer of an argument which they cannot immediately answer and show the insufficiency of it would methinks become all men to maintain peace and the common offices of humanity and friendship in the diversity of opinions since we cannot reasonably expect that any one should readily and obsequiously quit his own opinion and embrace ours with a blind resignation to an authority which the understanding of man acknowledges not for however it may often mistake it can own no other guide but reason nor blindly submit to the will and dictates of another,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
461,truth on other mens belief which they themselves have not searched into nor weighed the arguments of probability on which they should receive or reject it those who have fairly and truly examined and are thereby got past doubt in all the doctrines they profess and govern themselves by would have a juster pretence to require others to follow them but these are so few in number and find so little reason to be magisterial in their opinions that nothing insolent and imperious is to be expected from them and there is reason to think that if men were better instructed themselves they would be less imposing on others 5 probability is either of sensible matter of fact capable of human testimony or of what is beyond the evidence of our senses but to return to the grounds of assent and the several degrees of it we are to take notice,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
462,he does of the being and actions of his own acquaintance whereof he himself is a witness 9 experience and testimonies clashing infinitely vary the degrees of probability thus far the matter goes easy enough probability upon such grounds carries so much evidence with it that it naturally determines the judgment and leaves us as little liberty to believe or disbelieve as a demonstration does whether we will know or be ignorant the difficulty is when testimonies contradict common experience and the reports of history and witnesses clash with the ordinary course of nature or with one another there it is where diligence attention and exactness are required to form a right judgment and to proportion the assent to the different evidence and probability of the thing which rises and falls according as those two foundations of credibility viz common observation in like cases and particular testimonies in that particular instance,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
463,to take notice of a rule observed in the law of which is that though the attested copy of a record be good proof yet the copy of a copy ever so well attested and by ever so credible witnesses will not be admitted as a proof in judicature this is so generally approved as reasonable and suited to the wisdom and caution to be used in our inquiry after material truths that i never yet heard of any one that blamed it this practice if it be allowable in the decisions of right and wrong carries this observation along with it viz that any testimony the further off it is from the original truth the less force and proof it has the being and existence of the thing itself is what i call the original truth a credible man vouching his knowledge of it is a good proof but if,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
464,in things which sense cannot discover analogy is the great rule of probability secondly the probabilities we have hitherto mentioned are only such as concern matter of fact and such things as are capable of observation and testimony there remains that other sort concerning which men entertain opinions with variety of assent though the things be such that falling not under the reach of our senses they are not capable of testimony such are 1 the existence nature and operations of finite immaterial beings without us as spirits angels devils c or the existence of material beings which either for their smallness in themselves or remoteness from us our senses cannot take notice ofas whether there be any plants animals and intelligent inhabitants in the planets and other mansions of the vast universe 2 concerning the manner of operation in most parts of the works of nature wherein though we see,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
465,at by him who has the power to change the course of nature there under such circumstances that may be the fitter to procure belief by how much the more they are beyond or contrary to ordinary observation this is the proper case of miracles which well attested do not only find credit themselves but give it also to other truths which need such confirmation 14 the bare testimony of divine revelation is the highest certainty besides those we have hitherto mentioned there is one sort of propositions that challenge the highest degree of our assent upon bare testimony whether the thing proposed agree or disagree with common experience and the ordinary course of things or no the reason whereof is because the testimony is of such an one as cannot deceive nor be deceived and that is of god himself this carries with it an assurance beyond doubt evidence beyond,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
466,in the one and probability in the other is that which we call reason for as reason perceives the necessary and indubitable connexion of all the ideas or proofs one to another in each step of any demonstration that produces knowledge so it likewise perceives the probable connexion of all the ideas or proofs one to another in every step of a discourse to which it will think assent due this is the lowest degree of that which can be truly called reason for where the mind does not perceive this probable connexion where it does not discern whether there be any such connexion or no there mens opinions are not the product of judgment or the consequence of reason but the effects of chance and hazard of a mind floating at all adventures without choice and without direction 3 reason in its four degrees so that we may in reason,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
467,these several degrees may be observed in any mathematical demonstration it being one thing to perceive the connexion of each part as the demonstration is made by another another to perceive the dependence of the conclusion on all the parts a third to make out a demonstration clearly and neatly ones self and something different from all these to have first found out these intermediate ideas or proofs by which it is made 4 whether syllogism is the great instrument of reason there is one thing more which i shall desire to be considered concerning reason and that is whether syllogism as is generally thought be the proper instrument of it and the usefullest way of exercising this faculty the causes i have to doubt are these to doubt this first because syllogism serves our reason but in one only of the forementioned parts of it and that is to show,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
468,the probability which she easily perceives in things thus in their native state would be quite lost if this argument were managed learnedly and proposed in mode and figure for it very often confounds the connexion and i think every one will perceive in mathematical demonstrations that the knowledge gained thereby comes shortest and clearest without syllogism secondly because though syllogism serves to show the force or fallacy of an argument made use of in the usual way of discoursing by supplying the absent proposition and so setting it before the view in a clear light yet it no less engages the mind in the perplexity of obscure equivocal and fallacious terms wherewith this artificial way of reasoning always abounds it being adapted more to the attaining of victory in dispute than the discovery and confirmation of truth in fair enquiries 5 syllogism helps little in demonstration less in probability but,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
469,iron so he had brought to light but little of that treasure that lay so long hid in the dark entrails of and i am apt to think that he who shall employ all the force of his reason only in brandishing of syllogisms will discover very little of that mass of knowledge which lies yet concealed in the secret recesses of nature and which i am apt to think native rustic reason as it formerly has done is likelier to open a way to and add to the common stock of mankind rather than any scholastic proceeding by the strict rules of mode and figure 7 other helps to reason than syllogism should be sought i doubt not nevertheless but there are ways to be found to assist our reason in this most useful part and this the judicious encourages me to say who in his eccl pol 1 i,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
470,new and unborrowed i shall have given occasion to others to cast about for new discoveries and to seek in their own thoughts for those right helps of art which will scarce be found i fear by those who servilely confine themselves to the rules and dictates of others for beaten tracks lead this sort of cattle as an observing roman calls them whose thoughts reach only to imitation non quo eundum est sed quo itur but i can be bold to say that this age is adorned with some men of that strength of judgment and largeness of comprehension that if they would employ their thoughts on this subject could open new and undiscovered ways to the advancement of knowledge 8 we can reason about particulars and the immediate object of all our reasonings is nothing but particular ideas having here had occasion to speak of syllogism in general and,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
471,11 iii thirdly because we perceive not intermediate ideas to show conclusions our reason is often at a stand because it perceives not those ideas which could serve to show the certain or probable agreement or disagreement of any other two ideas and in this some mens faculties far outgo others till algebra that great instrument and instance of human sagacity was discovered men with amazement looked on several of the demonstrations of ancient mathematicians and could scarce forbear to think the finding several of those proofs to be something more than human 12 iv fourthly because we often proceed upon wrong principles the mind by proceeding upon false principles is often engaged in absurdities and difficulties brought into straits and contradictions without knowing how to free itself and in that case it is in vain to implore the help of reason unless it be to discover the falsehood and reject,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
472,no use of the discursive faculty no need of reasoning but they are known by a superior and higher degree of evidence and such if i may guess at things unknown i am apt to think that angels have now and the spirits of just men made perfect shall have in a future state of thousands of things which now either wholly escape our apprehensions or which our shortsighted reason having got some faint glimpse of we in the dark grope after 15 the next is got by reasoning but though we have here and there a little of this clear light some sparks of bright knowledge yet the greatest part of our ideas are such that we cannot discern their agreement or disagreement by an immediate comparing them and in all these we have need of reasoning and must by discourse and inference make our discoveries now of these there,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
473,to go over them again and there is need of more than one review before they can arrive at certainty but yet where the mind clearly retains the intuition it had of the agreement of any idea with another and that with a third and that with a fourth c there the agreement of the first and the fourth is a demonstration and produces certain knowledge which may be called rational knowledge as the other is intuitive 16 secondly to supply the narrowness of demonstrative and intuitive knowledge we have nothing but judgment upon probable reasoning secondly there are other ideas whose agreement or disagreement can no otherwise be judged of but by the intervention of others which have not a certain agreement with the extremes but an usual or likely one and in these is that the judgment is properly exercised which is the acquiescing of the mind that any,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
474,of it yet sometimes the intermediate ideas tie the extremes so firmly together and the probability is so clear and strong that assent as necessarily follows it as knowledge does demonstration the great excellency and use of the judgment is to observe right and take a true estimate of the force and weight of each probability and then casting them up all right together choose that side which has the overbalance 17 intuition demonstration judgment intuitive knowledge is the perception of the certain agreement or disagreement of two ideas immediately compared together rational knowledge is the perception of the certain agreement or disagreement of any two ideas by the intervention of one or more other ideas judgment is the thinking or taking two ideas to agree or disagree by the intervention of one or more ideas whose certain agreement or disagreement with them it does not perceive but hath observed to,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
475,way because he has shown me that i am in the wrong i may be modest and therefore not oppose another mans persuasion i may be ignorant and not be able to produce a better i may be in an error and another may show me that i am so this may dispose me perhaps for the reception of truth but helps me not to it that must come from proofs and arguments and light arising from the nature of things themselves and not from my shamefacedness ignorance or error 23 above contrary and according to reason by what has been before said of reason we may be able to make some guess at the distinction of things into those that are according to above and contrary to reason 1 according to reason are such propositions whose truth we can discover by examining and tracing those ideas we have from sensation,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
476,search and follow the clearer evidence and greater probability but since reason and faith are by some men opposed we will so consider them in the following chapter chapter xviii of faith and reason and their distinct provinces 1 necessary to know their boundaries it has been above shown 1 that we are of necessity ignorant and want knowledge of all sorts where we want ideas 2 that we are ignorant and want rational knowledge where we want proofs 3 that we want certain knowledge and certainty as far as we want clear and determined specific ideas 4 that we want probability to direct our assent in matters where we have neither knowledge of our own nor testimony of other men to bottom our reason upon from these things thus premised i think we may come to lay down the measures and boundaries between faith and reason the want whereof may,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
477,in the minds of other men those ideas imprinted by that sixth sense than one of us could convey the idea of any colour by the sound of words into a man who having the other four senses perfect had always totally wanted the fifth of seeing for our simple ideas then which are the foundation and sole matter of all our notions and knowledge we must depend wholly on our reason i mean our natural faculties and can by no means receive them or any of them from traditional revelation i say traditional revelation in distinction to original revelation by the one i mean that first impression which is made immediately by god on the mind of any man to which we cannot set any bounds and by the other those impressions delivered over to others in words and the ordinary ways of conveying our conceptions one to another 4,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
478,no greater an assurance than that of his senses that it is writ in the book supposed writ by inspired but he has not so great an assurance that wrote that book as if he had seen moses write it so that the assurance of its being a revelation is less still than the assurance of his senses 5 even original revelation cannot be admitted against the clear evidence of reason in propositions then whose certainty is built upon the clear perception of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas attained either by immediate intuition as in selfevident propositions or by evident deductions of reason in demonstrations we need not the assistance of revelation as necessary to gain our assent and introduce them into our minds because the natural ways of knowledge could settle them there or had done it already which is the greatest assurance we can possibly have of,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
479,can never have a clearer and perhaps not so clear evidence of anything to be a divine revelation as it has of the principles of its own reason it can never have a ground to quit the clear evidence of its reason to give a place to a proposition whose revelation has not a greater evidence than those principles have 6 traditional revelation much less thus far a man has use of reason and ought to hearken to it even in immediate and original revelation where it is supposed to be made to himself but to all those who pretend not to immediate revelation but are required to pay obedience and to receive the truths revealed to others which by the tradition of writings or word of mouth are conveyed down to them reason has a great deal more to do and is that only which can induce us to receive,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
480,for reason ever to procure any assent to that which to itself appears unreasonable in all things therefore where we have clear evidence from our ideas and those principles of knowledge i have above mentioned reason is the proper judge and revelation though it may in consenting with it confirm its dictates yet cannot in such cases invalidate its decrees nor can we be obliged where we have the clear and evident sentence of reason to quit it for the contrary opinion under a pretence that it is matter of faith which can have no authority against the plain and clear dictates of reason 7 thirdly things above reason are when revealed the proper matter of faith but thirdly there being many things wherein we have very imperfect notions or none at all and other things of whose past present or future existence by the natural use of our faculties we,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
481,discovery of reason are purely matters of faith with which reason has directly nothing to do 8 or not contrary to reason if revealed are and must carry it against probable conjectures of reason but since god in giving us the light of reason has not thereby tied up his own hands from affording us when he thinks fit the light of revelation in any of those matters wherein our natural faculties are able to give a probable determination revelation where god has been pleased to give it must carry it against the probable conjectures of reason because the mind not being certain of the truth of that it does not evidently know but only yielding to the probability that appears in it is bound to give up its assent to such a testimony which it is satisfied comes from one who cannot err and will not deceive but yet it,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
482,it without examination as a matter of faith 9 revelation in matters where reason cannot judge or but probably ought to be hearkened to first whatever proposition is revealed of whose truth our mind by its natural faculties and notions cannot judge that is purely matter of faith and above reason secondly all propositions whereof the mind by the use of its natural faculties can come to determine and judge from naturally acquired ideas are matter of reason with this difference still that in those concerning which it has but an uncertain evidence and so is persuaded of their truth only upon probable grounds which still admit a possibility of the contrary to be true without doing violence to the certain evidence of its own knowledge and overturning the principles of all reason in such probable propositions i say an evident revelation ought to determine our assent even against probability for,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

487,they offer to vouch anything contrary to these established rules how much the doctrine of innate principles and that principles are not to be proved or questioned has contributed to this i will not here examine this i readily grant that one truth cannot contradict another but withal i take leave also to say that every one ought very carefully to beware what he admits for a principle to examine it strictly and see whether he certainly knows it to be true of itself by its own evidence or whether he does only with assurance believe it to be so upon the authority of others for he hath a strong bias put into his understanding which will unavoidably misguide his assent who hath imbibed wrong principles and has blindly given himself up to the authority of any opinion in itself not evidently true 9 instilled in childhood there is nothing more,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

490,that i think we may conclude that in propositions where though the proofs in view are of most moment yet there are sufficient grounds to suspect that there is either fallacy in words or certain proofs as considerable to be produced on the contrary side there assent suspense or dissent are often voluntary actions but where the proofs are such as make it highly probable and there is not sufficient ground to suspect that there is either fallacy of words which sober and serious consideration may discover nor equally valid proofs yet undiscovered latent on the other side which also the nature of the thing may in some cases make plain to a considerate man there i think a man who has weighed them can scarce refuse his assent to the side on which the greater probability appears whether it be probable that a promiscuous jumble of printing letters should often,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment
491,last wrong measure of probability i shall take notice of and which keeps in ignorance or error more people than all the other together is that which i have mentioned in the foregoing chapter i mean the giving up our assent to the common received opinions either of our friends or party neighbourhood or country how many men have no other ground for their tenets than the supposed honesty or learning or number of those of the same profession as if honest or bookish men could not err or truth were to be established by the vote of the multitude yet this with most men serves the turn the tenet has had the attestation of reverend antiquity it comes to me with the passport of former ages and therefore i am secure in the reception i give it other men have been and are of the same opinion for that is,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

1541,some way or other if i could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful i should not be shy but you would still be reserved said and that is worse edward startedreserved am i reserved marianne yes very i do not understand you replied he colouring reservedhow in what manner what am i to tell you what can you suppose looked surprised at his emotion but trying to laugh off the subject she said to him do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself edward made no answer his gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him in their fullest extentand he sat for some time silent and dull chapter 18 elinor saw with great uneasiness the low spirits of her,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1542,to myself because i could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning i am convinced said that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel but in return your sister must allow me to feel no more than i profess i like a fine prospect but not on picturesque principles i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees i admire them much more if they are tall straight and flourishing i do not like ruined tattered cottages i am not fond of nettles or thistles or heath blossoms i have more pleasure in a snug farmhouse than a watchtowerand a troop of tidy happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the world looked with amazement at with compassion at her sister only laughed the subject was continued no farther,JaneAustin,female,victorian

1544,you think now it has been and is and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me that i have had no necessary business to engage me no profession to give me employment or afford me any thing like independence but unfortunately my own nicety and the nicety of my friends have made me what i am an idle helpless being we never could agree in our choice of a profession i always preferred the church as i still do but that was not smart enough for my family they recommended the army that was a great deal too smart for me the law was allowed to be genteel enough many young men who had chambers in the made a very good appearance in the first circles and drove about town in very knowing gigs but i had no inclination for the law even in this less abstruse study of,JaneAustin,female,victorian

1546,of her own appeared no more meritorious to than her own had seemed faulty to her the business of selfcommand she settled very easilywith strong affections it was impossible with calm ones it could have no merit that her sisters affections were calm she dared not deny though she blushed to acknowledge it and of the strength of her own she gave a very striking proof by still loving and respecting that sister in spite of this mortifying conviction without shutting herself up from her family or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of and of behaviour in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different times could producewith tenderness pity approbation censure and doubt there were moments in abundance when if not by the,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1547,to find wit in the inattention of any one and could not help looking with surprise at them both in the meantime talked on as loud as she could and continued her account of their surprise the evening before on seeing their friends without ceasing till every thing was told laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment and every body agreed two or three times over that it had been quite an agreeable surprise you may believe how glad we all were to see them added leaning forward towards and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else though they were seated on different sides of the room but however i cant help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast nor made such a long journey of it for they came all round by upon account of some business for you,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1548,now said by these frequent invitations than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago the alteration is not in them if their parties are grown tedious and dull we must look for the change elsewhere chapter 20 as the miss dashwoods entered the drawingroom of the park the next day at one door came running in at the other looking as good humoured and merry as before she took them all most affectionately by the hand and expressed great delight in seeing them again i am so glad to see you said she seating herself between and for it is so bad a day i was afraid you might not come which would be a shocking thing as we go away again tomorrow we must go for the westons come to us next week you know it was quite a sudden thing our coming at all and,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1549,some unaccountable bias in favour of beauty he was the husband of a very silly womanbut she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it it was rather a wish of distinction she believed which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body and his general abuse of every thing before him it was the desire of appearing superior to other people the motive was too common to be wondered at but the means however they might succeed by establishing his superiority in illbreeding were not likely to attach any one to him except his wife oh my dear miss said soon afterwards i have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister will you come and spend some time at this christmas now pray doand come while the westons are with us you cannot think how happy,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1550,been in the country together he is very little at combe i believe but if he were ever so much there i do not think mr would visit him for he is in the opposition you know and besides it is such a way off i know why you inquire about him very well your sister is to marry him i am monstrous glad of it for then i shall have her for a neighbour you know upon my word replied you know much more of the matter than i do if you have any reason to expect such a match dont pretend to deny it because you know it is what every body talks of i assure you i heard of it in my way through town my dear upon my honour i didi met colonel brandon in bondstreet just before we left town and he told me of it,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1551,i said to him so colonel there is a new family come to cottage i hear and mama sends me word they are very pretty and that one of them is going to be married to of is it true pray for of course you must know as you have been in so lately and what did the colonel say ohhe did not say much but he looked as if he knew it to be true so from that moment i set it down as certain it will be quite delightful i declare when is it to take place mr was very well i hope oh yes quite well and so full of your praises he did nothing but say fine things of you i am flattered by his commendation he seems an excellent man and i think him uncommonly pleasing so do ihe is such a charming man that it,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1552,think him extremely agreeable i assure you nobody is more liked than wherever he goes and so you may tell your sister she is a monstrous lucky girl to get him upon my honour not but that he is much more lucky in getting her because she is so very handsome and agreeable that nothing can be good enough for her however i dont think her hardly at all handsomer than you i assure you for i think you both excessively pretty and so does mr too i am sure though we could not get him to own it information respecting was not very material but any testimony in his favour however small was pleasing to her i am so glad we are got acquainted at last continued charlotteand now i hope we shall always be great friends you cant think how much i longed to see you it is so,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1553,admiration sir confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the miss dashwoods of the arrival and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls in the world from such commendation as this however there was not much to be learned well knew that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of under every possible variation of form face temper and understanding sir wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly and look at his guests benevolent philanthropic man it was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself do come now said hepray comeyou must comei declare you shall comeyou cant think how you will like them lucy is monstrous pretty and so good humoured and agreeable the children are all hanging about her already,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1554,by the other with such a reward for her tears the child was too wise to cease crying she still screamed and sobbed lustily kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her and all their united soothings were ineffectual till lady luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected she was carried out of the room therefore in her mothers arms in quest of this medicine and as the two boys chose to follow though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours poor,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1555,they were gone it might have been a very sad accident yet i hardly know how cried unless it had been under totally different circumstances but this is the usual way of heightening alarm where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality what a sweet woman lady is said was silent it was impossible for her to say what she did not feel however trivial the occasion and upon therefore the whole task of telling lies when politeness required it always fell she did her best when thus called on by speaking of lady with more warmth than she felt though with far less than miss lucy and sir too cried the elder sister what a charming man he is here too miss dashwoods commendation being only simple and just came in without any eclat she merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly and what a,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1556,sir admire it excessively said who seemed to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister i think every one must admire it replied who ever saw the place though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do and had you a great many smart beaux there i suppose you have not so many in this part of the world for my part i think they are a vast addition always but why should you think said looking ashamed of her sister that there are not as many genteel young men in as my dear im sure i dont pretend to say that there ant im sure theres a vast many smart beaux in but you know how could i tell what smart beaux there might be about and i was only afraid the might find it dull at if they,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1557,its a great secret repeated is the happy man is he what your sisterinlaws brother miss dashwood a very agreeable young man to be sure i know him very well how can you say so cried lucy who generally made an amendment to all her sisters assertions though we have seen him once or twice at my uncles it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well elinor heard all this with attention and surprise and who was this uncle where did he live how came they acquainted she wished very much to have the subject continued though she did not chuse to join in it herself but nothing more of it was said and for the first time in her life she thought deficient either in curiosity after petty information or in a disposition to communicate it the manner in which miss had spoken of edward increased,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1558,nothing of her i am sure you think me very strange for enquiring about her in such a way said eyeing attentively as she spoke but perhaps there may be reasonsi wish i might venture but however i hope you will do me the justice of believing that i do not mean to be impertinent made her a civil reply and they walked on for a few minutes in silence it was broken by who renewed the subject again by saying with some hesitation i cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious i am sure i would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours and i am sure i should not have the smallest fear of trusting you indeed i should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1559,as it was strong had not an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it she turned towards in silent amazement unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration and though her complexion varied she stood firm in incredulity and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit or a swoon you may well be surprised continued lucy for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before for i dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family because it was always meant to be a great secret and i am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour not a soul of all my relations know of it but and i never should have mentioned it to you if i had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy and,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1560,when he knows i have trusted you because i know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family and looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite as his own sistersshe paused for a few moments remained silent her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words but at length forcing herself to speak and to speak cautiously she said with calmness of manner which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude i ask if your engagement is of long standing we have been engaged these four years four years yes though greatly shocked still felt unable to believe it i did not know said she that you were even acquainted till the other day our acquaintance however is of many years date he was under my uncles care you know a considerable while your uncle yes mr did you never hear,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1561,making such particular inquiries about mother and i am so unfortunate that i have not a creature whose advice i can ask is the only person that knows of it and she has no judgment at all indeed she does me a great deal more harm than good for i am in constant fear of her betraying me she does not know how to hold her tongue as you must perceive and i am sure i was in the greatest fright in the world tother day when name was mentioned by sir lest she should out with it all you cant think how much i go through in my mind from it altogether i only wonder that i am alive after what i have suffered for sake these last four years every thing in such suspense and uncertainty and seeing him so seldomwe can hardly meet above twice ayear i am,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1562,directly at her companion but then at other times i have not resolution enough for it i cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable as i know the very mention of such a thing would do and on my own account tooso dear as he is to mei dont think i could be equal to it what would you advise me to do in such a case miss dashwood what would you do yourself pardon me replied startled by the question but i can give you no advice under such circumstances your own judgment must direct you to be sure continued lucy after a few minutes silence on both sides his mother must provide for him sometime or other but poor is so cast down by it did you not think him dreadful lowspirited when he was at he was so miserable when he left us at longstaple to,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1563,necessary and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings that her success was speedy and for the time complete writing to each other said returning the letter into her pocket is the only comfort we have in such long separations yes i have one other comfort in his picture but poor has not even that if he had but my picture he says he should be easy i gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at longstaple last and that was some comfort to him he said but not equal to a picture perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him i did said with a composure of voice under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before she was mortified shocked confounded fortunately for her they had now reached the cottage,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1564,the rest at once indisputable and alarming and visit near his melancholy state of mind his dissatisfaction at his own prospects his uncertain behaviour towards herself the intimate knowledge of the as to and their family connections which had often surprised her the picture the letter the ring formed altogether such a body of evidence as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly and established as a fact which no partiality could set aside his illtreatment of herselfher resentment of such behaviour her indignation at having been its dupe for a short time made her feel only for herself but other ideas other considerations soon arose had edward been intentionally deceiving her had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel was his engagement to lucy an engagement of the heart no whatever it might once have been she could not believe it such at present his affection,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1565,a secret so confessedly and evidently important and even sir johns joking intelligence must have had some weight but indeed while remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that lucy should be jealous and that she was so her very confidence was a proof what other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be but that might be informed by it of lucys superior claims on and be taught to avoid him in future she had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rivals intentions and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed to combat her own affection for and to see him as little as possible she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince lucy that her heart was,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1566,at it for it is the very best toned pianoforte i ever heard the remaining five were now to draw their cards perhaps continued if i should happen to cut out i may be of some use to miss in rolling her papers for her and there is so much still to be done to the basket that it must be impossible i think for her labour singly to finish it this evening i should like the work exceedingly if she would allow me a share in it indeed i shall be very much obliged to you for your help cried lucy for i find there is more to be done to it than i thought there was and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear after all oh that would be terrible indeed said dear little soul how i do love her you are very kind said to,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1567,very glad to find it was only my own fancy and that you really do not blame me if you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what i am always thinking of every moment of my life your compassion would make you overlook every thing else i am sure indeed i can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you to acknowledge your situation to me and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it your case is a very unfortunate one you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them mr i believe is entirely dependent on his mother he has only two thousand pounds of his own it would be madness to marry upon that though for my,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1568,have seen enough of edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can and then through your interest which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him and i hope out of some regard to me your brother might be persuaded to give him living which i understand is a very good one and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while that would be enough for us to marry upon and we might trust to time and chance for the rest i should always be happy replied to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for mr but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary he is brother to mrs must be recommendation enough,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1569,that your judgment might justly have such weight with me if you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings your opinion would not be worth having thought it wisest to make no answer to this lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve and was even partly determined never to mention the subject again another pause therefore of many minutes duration succeeded this speech and was still the first to end it shall you be in town miss said she with all her accustomary complacency certainly not i am sorry for that returned the other while her eyes brightened at the information it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there but i dare say you will go for all that to be sure your brother and sister will ask you to come to them it will,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1570,the subject was never revived by and when entered on by who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it and was particularly careful to inform her confidante of her happiness whenever she received a letter from it was treated by the former with calmness and caution and dismissed as soon as civility would allow for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which did not deserve and which were dangerous to herself the visit of the at was lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied their favour increased they could not be spared sir would not hear of their going and in spite of their numerous and long arranged engagements in in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately which was in full force at the end of every week they were prevailed on to stay nearly two months at the park and to assist,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1571,going to that fastidious as she was thoroughly acquainted with manners and invariably disgusted by them should overlook every inconvenience of that kind should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings in her pursuit of one object was such a proof so strong so full of the importance of that object to her as elinor in spite of all that had passed was not prepared to witness on being informed of the invitation persuaded that such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her daughters and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to herself how much the heart of was in it would not hear of their declining the offer upon her account insisted on their both accepting it directly and then began to foresee with her usual cheerfulness a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all from this separation i am delighted,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1572,very much and shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest of the family it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether i am ever known to them or not smiled and said nothing lifted up her eyes in astonishment and conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue after very little farther discourse it was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted received the information with a great deal of joy and many assurances of kindness and care nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her sir was delighted for to a man whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of being alone the acquisition of two to the number of inhabitants in was something even lady took the trouble of being delighted which was putting herself rather out of her way and as for the miss steeles especially,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1573,must be engaged this conviction though not entirely satisfactory gave her pleasure and she continued her letter with greater alacrity was finished in a very few minutes in length it could be no more than a note it was then folded up sealed and directed with eager rapidity thought she could distinguish a large w in the direction and no sooner was it complete than ringing the bell requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed for her to the twopenny post this decided the matter at once her spirits still continued very high but there was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister and this agitation increased as the evening drew on she could scarcely eat any dinner and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage it was a great satisfaction,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1574,ensured his welcome with her and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him she instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him that he even observed as she quitted the room with such astonishment and concern as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself is your sister ill said he elinor answered in some distress that she was and then talked of headaches low spirits and over fatigues and of every thing to which she could decently attribute her sisters behaviour he heard her with the most earnest attention but seeming to recollect himself said no more on the subject and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in making the usual inquiries about their journey and the friends they had left behind in this,JaneAustin,female,victorian

1576,with them the former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements and was obliged to assist in making a whist table for the others was of no use on these occasions as she would never learn the game but though her time was therefore at her own disposal the was by no means more productive of pleasure to her than to for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the pain of disappointment she sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read but the book was soon thrown aside and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window in hopes of distinguishing the longexpected rap chapter 27 if this open weather holds much longer said when they met at breakfast the following morning sir will not like leaving,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1577,with style of living and set of acquaintance than with her behaviour to themselves which was invariably kind every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan and excepting a few old city friends whom to lady middletons regret she had never dropped she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties which whether at home or abroad formed only for cards could have little to amuse her colonel who had a general invitation to the house was with them almost every day he came to look at and talk to who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence,JaneAustin,female,victorian

1580,impatiently expected its opening it was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction for more than once before beginning with the observation of your sister looks unwell today or your sister seems out of spirits he had appeared on the point either of disclosing or of inquiring something particular about her after a pause of several minutes their silence was broken by his asking her in a voice of some agitation when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother was not prepared for such a question and having no answer ready was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient of asking what he meant he tried to smile as he replied your sisters engagement to is very generally known it cannot be generally known returned for her own family do not know it he looked surprised and said i beg your,JaneAustin,female,victorian
1581,regret what she had done in applying to her mother for neither came nor wrote they were engaged about the end of that time to attend lady to a party from which was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter and for this party wholly dispirited careless of her appearance and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid prepared without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure she sat by the drawingroom fire after tea till the moment of lady middletons arrival without once stirring from her seat or altering her attitude lost in her own thoughts and insensible of her sisters presence and when at last they were told that lady waited for them at the door she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected they arrived in due time at the place of destination and as soon as the string,JaneAustin,female,victorian

1583,his own misconduct and prevented her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with the affections of her sister from the first without any design that would bear investigation absence might have weakened his regard and convenience might have determined him to overcome it but that such a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt as for on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already have given her and on those still more severe which might await her in its probable consequence she could not reflect without the deepest concern her own situation gained in the comparison for while she could esteem edward as much as ever however they might be divided in future her mind might be always supported but every circumstance that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery of in a final separation from an,JaneAustin,female,victorian
