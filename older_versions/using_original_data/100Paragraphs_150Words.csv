241,to the men who sought gold under the shadow of the pole buck did not like it but he bore up well to the work taking pride in it after the manner of dave and solleks and seeing that his mates whether they prided in it or not did their fair share it was a monotonous life operating with machinelike regularity one day was very like another at a certain time each morning the cooks turned out fires were built and breakfast was eaten then while some broke camp others harnessed the dogs and they were under way an hour or so before the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn at night camp was made some pitched the flies others cut firewood and pine boughs for the beds and still others carried water or ice for the cooks also the dogs were fed to them this was the one feature,JackLondon,male,naturalism
242,three battles with the fiercest brought buck to mastery so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got out of his way best of all perhaps he loved to lie near the fire hind legs crouched under him fore legs stretched out in front head raised and eyes blinking dreamily at the flames sometimes he thought of judge millers big house in the sunkissed santa clara valley and of the cement swimmingtank and ysabel the mexican hairless and toots the japanese pug but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater the death of curly the great fight with spitz and the good things he had eaten or would like to eat he was not homesick the sunland was very dim and distant and such memories had no power over him far more potent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never seen before,JackLondon,male,naturalism

388,executive power placed any where but in a person that has also a share in the legislative is visibly subordinate and accountable to it and may be at pleasure changed and displaced so that it is not the supreme executive power that is exempt from subordination but the supreme executive power vested in one who having a share in the legislative has no distinct superior legislative to be subordinate and accountable to farther than he himself shall join and consent so that he is no more subordinate than he himself shall think fit which one may certainly conclude will be but very little of other ministerial and subordinate powers in a commonwealth we need not speak they being so multiplied with infinite variety in the different customs and constitutions of distinct commonwealths that it is impossible to give a particular account of them all only thus much which is necessary to,JohnLocke,male,enlightenment

534,fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must be dreadful i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardly be just to him elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his father she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiablebut she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner we were born in the same parish within the,JaneAustin,female,victorian
535,gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged that she would not make herself uneasy i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a cardtable they must take their chances of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters mr wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her,JaneAustin,female,victorian
536,patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride for her nephew who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickhams attentions there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs phillipss supper,JaneAustin,female,victorian
537,jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham the possibility of his having endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing remained therefore to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side,JaneAustin,female,victorian
538,not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once no aunt no officers no news could be sought afterthe very shoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia chapter 18 till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to,JaneAustin,female,victorian
539,in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her i dare say you will find him very agreeable heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr,JaneAustin,female,victorian
540,length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friendswhether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr darcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to the first circles allow me to say however,JaneAustin,female,victorian
541,not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine what think you of books said he smiling booksoh no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions noi cannot talk of books in a ballroom my head is always full of something else the present always occupies you in such scenesdoes it said he with a look of doubt yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say,JaneAustin,female,victorian
542,lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy indeed i am i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier i believe him to be lady catherines nephew it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennight elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either,JaneAustin,female,victorian
543,talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected elizabeth was in agonies she looked at jane to see,JaneAustin,female,victorian
544,house to themselves they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests darcy said nothing at all mr bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of,JaneAustin,female,victorian
545,gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond anything i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed towards longbourn instead of my,JaneAustin,female,victorian
546,all disapprove of you and you may be certain when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualification indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any selfreproach this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had mr collins not thus addressed her when i do myself the,JaneAustin,female,victorian
547,of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character this information however startled mrs bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not believe it and could not help saying so but depend upon it mr collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason i will speak to her about it directly she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a,JaneAustin,female,victorian
548,not have her mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech of what are you talking of mr collins and lizzy lizzy declares she will not have mr collins and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy and what am i to do on the occasion it seems an hopeless business speak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon her marrying him let her be called down she shall hear my opinion mrs bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library come here child cried her father as she appeared i have sent for you on an affair of importance,JaneAustin,female,victorian
549,silent on this point far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation you will not i hope consider me as showing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority,JaneAustin,female,victorian
550,attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennets illhumour or ill health mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he meant to stay after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody was well talked over to,JaneAustin,female,victorian
551,is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to townand without any intention of coming back again you shall hear what she says she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine in grosvenor street where mr hurst had a house the next was in these words i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence i depend on you for that to these highflown expressions,JaneAustin,female,victorian
552,may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he should why will you think so it must be his own doing he is his own master but you do not know all i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from you mr darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something,JaneAustin,female,victorian
553,hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses chapter 22 the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her it keeps him in good humour said she,JaneAustin,female,victorian
554,express charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them towards herself such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they,JaneAustin,female,victorian
555,a very agreeable companion but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before the possibility of mr collinss fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to mr collins my dear charlotteimpossible the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why,JaneAustin,female,victorian
556,he unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord sir william how can you tell such a story do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother,JaneAustin,female,victorian
557,he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away,JaneAustin,female,victorian
558,think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take her place in it my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for better things let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was not for the entail i should not mind it what should not you mind i should not mind anything at all let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility i never can be thankful mr bennet for anything about the entail how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from,JaneAustin,female,victorian
559,concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation her heart was divided between concern for her,JaneAustin,female,victorian
560,really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlottes marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper consider mr collinss respectability and charlottes steady prudent character remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for everybodys sake that she may feel something like regard,JaneAustin,female,victorian
561,sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect janes good fortune true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it mr wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known anything of the matter miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any,JaneAustin,female,victorian
562,his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractions miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped by carolines not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn and what with the phillipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of itof which officers mr wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm commendation narrowly observed them,JaneAustin,female,victorian
563,assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that she wished they might be happy thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room as they went downstairs together charlotte,JaneAustin,female,victorian
564,in all this but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happyyour affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear from you very soon miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty we had better not mention it i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford pray go to see them with sir william and maria i am sure you will be very comfortable thereyours etc this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over she would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions his character sunk on every,JaneAustin,female,victorian
565,that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think she is a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm of her but he paid,JaneAustin,female,victorian
566,furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself to work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump but of all the,JaneAustin,female,victorian
567,built and convenient and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit when mr collins could be forgotten there was really an air of great comfort throughout and by charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister maria,JaneAustin,female,victorian
568,ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary in spite of having been at st jamess sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly lady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of,JaneAustin,female,victorian
569,visitors forget their inferior rank she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her selfimportance and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he represented when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said,JaneAustin,female,victorian
570,most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them the party did not supply much conversation elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourghthe former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinnertime mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire when the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used,JaneAustin,female,victorian
571,miss bennet a little oh thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you our instrument is a capital one probably superior toyou shall try it some day do your sisters play and sing one of them does why did not you all learn you ought all to have learned the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as yours do you draw no not at all what none of you not one that is very strange but i suppose you had no opportunity your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london has your governess left you we never had any governess no governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing,JaneAustin,female,victorian
572,from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands chapter 30 sir william stayed only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with while sir william was with them mr collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they,JaneAustin,female,victorian
573,minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs collinss joints of meat were too large for her family,JaneAustin,female,victorian
574,there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with,JaneAustin,female,victorian
575,her daughter colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had seen only at church the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherines drawingroom her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them anything was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had,JaneAustin,female,victorian

711,topics of general and family interest nevertheless he reflected she was the only one of his family with whom he found it possible to discuss happiness although he might very well have discussed happiness with miss hilbery at their first meeting he looked critically at joan and wished that she did not look so provincial or suburban in her high green dress with the faded trimming so patient and almost resigned he began to wish to tell her about the hilberys in order to abuse them for in the miniature battle which so often rages between two quickly following impressions of life the life of the hilberys was getting the better of the life of the denhams in his mind and he wanted to assure himself that there was some quality in which joan infinitely surpassed miss hilbery he should have felt that his own sister was more original and had,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

714,concentrate her mind to the utmost perhaps the unwomanly nature of the science made her instinctively wish to conceal her love of it but the more profound reason was that in her mind mathematics were directly opposed to literature she would not have cared to confess how infinitely she preferred the exactitude the starlike impersonality of figures to the confusion agitation and vagueness of the finest prose there was something a little unseemly in thus opposing the tradition of her family something that made her feel wrongheaded and thus more than ever disposed to shut her desires away from view and cherish them with extraordinary fondness again and again she was thinking of some problem when she should have been thinking of her grandfather waking from these trances she would see that her mother too had lapsed into some dream almost as visionary as her own for the people who played,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

716,and tell him how much we liked it said mary thus suggesting an action which ralph was anxious to take though without her he would have been too proud to do it for he suspected that he had more interest in katharine than she had in him that was a very interesting paper mary began without any shyness seating herself on the floor opposite to rodney and katharine will you lend me the manuscript to read in peace rodney who had opened his eyes on their approach regarded her for a moment in suspicious silence do you say that merely to disguise the fact of my ridiculous failure he asked katharine looked up from her reading with a smile he says he doesnt mind what we think of him she remarked he says we dont care a rap for art of any kind i asked her to pity me and she,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
717,besides having to answer rodney he was not sure that the remark with its assertion of intimacy would not strike katharine as impertinent she was listening to what some one in another group was saying rodney meanwhile was talking about the elizabethan dramatists he was a curiouslooking man since upon first sight especially if he chanced to be talking with animation he appeared in some way ridiculous but next moment in repose his face with its large nose thin cheeks and lips expressing the utmost sensibility somehow recalled a roman head bound with laurel cut upon a circle of semitransparent reddish stone it had dignity and character by profession a clerk in a government office he was one of those martyred spirits to whom literature is at once a source of divine joy and of almost intolerable irritation not content to rest in their love of it they must attempt to,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

719,observed that when a pedestrian going the opposite way forced them to part they came together again directly afterwards without intending to watch them he never quite lost sight of the yellow scarf twisted round katharines head or the light overcoat which made rodney look fashionable among the crowd at the strand he supposed that they would separate but instead they crossed the road and took their way down one of the narrow passages which lead through ancient courts to the river among the crowd of people in the big thoroughfares rodney seemed merely to be lending katharine his escort but now when passengers were rare and the footsteps of the couple were distinctly heard in the silence denham could not help picturing to himself some change in their conversation the effect of the light and shadow which seemed to increase their height was to make them mysterious and significant so,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

723,things such as eating ones breakfast alone in a room which had nice colors in it clean from the skirting of the boards to the corners of the ceiling seemed to suit her so thoroughly that she used at first to hunt about for some one to apologize to or for some flaw in the situation she had now been six months in london and she could find no flaw but that as she invariably concluded by the time her boots were laced was solely and entirely due to the fact that she had her work every day as she stood with her dispatchbox in her hand at the door of her flat and gave one look back into the room to see that everything was straight before she left she said to herself that she was very glad that she was going to leave it all that to have sat,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
724,jocular hints upon keeping papers in order the typewriting would stop abruptly and mrs seal would burst into the room with a letter which needed explanation in her hand this was a more serious interruption than the other because she never knew exactly what she wanted and half a dozen requests would bolt from her no one of which was clearly stated dressed in plumcolored velveteen with short gray hair and a face that seemed permanently flushed with philanthropic enthusiasm she was always in a hurry and always in some disorder she wore two crucifixes which got themselves entangled in a heavy gold chain upon her breast and seemed to mary expressive of her mental ambiguity only her vast enthusiasm and her worship of miss markham one of the pioneers of the society kept her in her place for which she had no sound qualification so the morning wore on and,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
725,solitude and chill and silence of the gallery as to the actual beauty of the statues one must suppose at least that her emotions were not purely esthetic because after she had gazed at the ulysses for a minute or two she began to think about ralph denham so secure did she feel with these silent shapes that she almost yielded to an impulse to say i am in love with you aloud the presence of this immense and enduring beauty made her almost alarmingly conscious of her desire and at the same time proud of a feeling which did not display anything like the same proportions when she was going about her daily work she repressed her impulse to speak aloud and rose and wandered about rather aimlessly among the statues until she found herself in another gallery devoted to engraved obelisks and winged assyrian bulls and her emotion took,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

730,make you angry she asked katharine but considering that every one tells lies katharine remarked looking about the room to see where she had put down her umbrella and her parcel for there was an intimacy in the way in which mary and ralph addressed each other which made her wish to leave them mary on the other hand was anxious superficially at least that katharine should stay and so fortify her in her determination not to be in love with ralph ralph while lifting his cup from his lips to the table had made up his mind that if miss hilbery left he would go with her i dont think that i tell lies and i dont think that ralph tells lies do you ralph mary continued katharine laughed with more gayety as it seemed to mary than she could properly account for what was she laughing at at them,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
731,passed through his mind that if he missed this chance of talking to katharine he would have to face an enraged ghost when he was alone in his room again demanding an explanation of his cowardly indecision it was better on the whole to risk present discomfiture than to waste an evening bandying excuses and constructing impossible scenes with this uncompromising section of himself for ever since he had visited the hilberys he had been much at the mercy of a phantom katharine who came to him when he sat alone and answered him as he would have her answer and was always beside him to crown those varying triumphs which were transacted almost every night in imaginary scenes as he walked through the lamplit streets home from the office to walk with katharine in the flesh would either feed that phantom with fresh food which as all who nourish dreams,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

733,pass out of life herself without laying the ghost of her parents sorrow to rest katharine wished to comfort her mother but it was difficult to do this satisfactorily when the facts themselves were so much of a legend the house in russell square for example with its noble rooms and the magnoliatree in the garden and the sweetvoiced piano and the sound of feet coming down the corridors and other properties of size and romancehad they any existence yet why should mrs alardyce live all alone in this gigantic mansion and if she did not live alone with whom did she live for its own sake katharine rather liked this tragic story and would have been glad to hear the details of it and to have been able to discuss them frankly but this it became less and less possible to do for though mrs hilbery was constantly reverting to,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
734,her letters she could not doubt but that williams letter was the most genuine she had yet received from him he had come to the conclusion that he could not live without her he wrote he believed that he knew her and could give her happiness and that their marriage would be unlike other marriages nor was the sonnet in spite of its accomplishment lacking in passion and katharine as she read the pages through again could see in what direction her feelings ought to flow supposing they revealed themselves she would come to feel a humorous sort of tenderness for him a zealous care for his susceptibilities and after all she considered thinking of her father and mother what is love naturally with her face position and background she had experience of young men who wished to marry her and made protestations of love but perhaps because she did not,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

736,had written she might have been a schoolmaster criticizing a childs essay her face gave mrs hilbery who watched it anxiously no ground for hope its very beautiful she stated but you see mother we ought to go from point to point oh i know mrs hilbery exclaimed and thats just what i cant do things keep coming into my head it isnt that i dont know everything and feel everything who did know him if i didnt but i cant put it down you see theres a kind of blind spot she said touching her forehead there and when i cant sleep o nights i fancy i shall die without having done it from exultation she had passed to the depths of depression which the imagination of her death aroused the depression communicated itself to katharine how impotent they were fiddling about all day long with papers and the clock,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
737,an imperial crown ah you wretch mrs hilbery exclaimed what a wicked old despot you were in your day how we all bowed down before you maggie she used to say if it hadnt been for me where would you be now and it was true she brought them together you know she said to my father marry her and he did and she said to poor little clara fall down and worship him and she did but she got up again of course what else could one expect she was a mere childeighteenand half dead with fright too but that old tyrant never repented she used to say that she had given them three perfect months and no one had a right to more and i sometimes think katharine thats true you know its more than most of us have only we have to pretend which was a thing neither,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
738,a hilbery the complexities of the family relationship were such that each was at once first and second cousin to the other and thus aunt and cousin to the culprit cyril so that his misbehavior was almost as much cousin carolines affair as aunt celias cousin caroline was a lady of very imposing height and circumference but in spite of her size and her handsome trappings there was something exposed and unsheltered in her expression as if for many summers her thin red skin and hooked nose and reduplication of chins so much resembling the profile of a cockatoo had been bared to the weather she was indeed a single lady but she had it was the habit to say made a life for herself and was thus entitled to be heard with respect this unhappy business she began out of breath as she was if the train had not gone,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
739,any sudden relaxation of his grasp upon what he held though as she knew from inspection of her own life such sudden impulse to let go and make away from the discipline and the drudgery was sometimes almost irresistible but with ralph if he broke away she knew that it would be only to put himself under harsher constraint she figured him toiling through sandy deserts under a tropical sun to find the source of some river or the haunt of some fly she figured him living by the labor of his hands in some city slum the victim of one of those terrible theories of right and wrong which were current at the time she figured him prisoner for life in the house of a woman who had seduced him by her misfortunes half proudly and wholly anxiously she framed such thoughts as they sat late at night talking together,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
740,a natural liking and was in process of turning him from tory to radical after a course of public meetings which began by boring him acutely and ended by exciting him even more than they excited her but he was reserved when ideas started up in his mind he divided them automatically into those he could discuss with mary and those he must keep for himself she knew this and it interested her for she was accustomed to find young men very ready to talk about themselves and had come to listen to them as one listens to children without any thought of herself but with ralph she had very little of this maternal feeling and in consequence a much keener sense of her own individuality late one afternoon ralph stepped along the strand to an interview with a lawyer upon business the afternoon light was almost over and already streams,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
741,interested in the question mary unconsciously let her attention wander and a great desire came over her to talk to ralph about her own feelings or at any rate about something personal so that she might see what he felt for her but she resisted this wish but she could not prevent him from feeling her lack of interest in what he was saying and gradually they both became silent one thought after another came up in ralphs mind but they were all in some way connected with katharine or with vague feelings of romance and adventure such as she inspired but he could not talk to mary about such thoughts and he pitied her for knowing nothing of what he was feeling here he thought is where we differ from women they have no sense of romance well mary he said at length why dont you say something amusing his,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
742,to be getting wrapped up in your work and is that a bad thing she asked shading her eyes with her hand i think it is he returned abruptly but only a week ago you were saying the opposite her tone was defiant but she became curiously depressed ralph did not perceive it and took this opportunity of lecturing her and expressing his latest views upon the proper conduct of life she listened but her main impression was that he had been meeting some one who had influenced him he was telling her that she ought to read more and to see that there were other points of view as deserving of attention as her own naturally having last seen him as he left the office in company with katharine she attributed the change to her it was likely that katharine on leaving the scene which she had so clearly despised,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
743,her own attitude but she knew that ralph would never admit that he had been influenced by anybody you dont read enough mary he was saying you ought to read more poetry it was true that marys reading had been rather limited to such works as she needed to know for the sake of examinations and her time for reading in london was very little for some reason no one likes to be told that they do not read enough poetry but her resentment was only visible in the way she changed the position of her hands and in the fixed look in her eyes and then she thought to herself im behaving exactly as i said i wouldnt behave whereupon she relaxed all her muscles and said in her reasonable way tell me what i ought to read then ralph had unconsciously been irritated by mary and he now delivered,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

745,peevishness no it doesnt interest me very much she replied candidly what shall we talk about then he asked she looked rather whimsically round the walls of the room however we start we end by talking about the same thingabout poetry i mean i wonder if you realize william that ive never read even shakespeare its rather wonderful how ive kept it up all these years youve kept it up for ten years very beautifully as far as im concerned he said ten years so long as that and i dont think its always bored you he added she looked into the fire silently she could not deny that the surface of her feeling was absolutely unruffled by anything in williams character on the contrary she felt certain that she could deal with whatever turned up he gave her peace in which she could think of things that were far removed,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
746,same spot in the hearers brain still she reflected these sorts of skill are almost exclusively masculine women neither practice them nor know how to value them and ones husbands proficiency in this direction might legitimately increase ones respect for him since mystification is no bad basis for respect no one could doubt that william was a scholar the reading ended with the finish of the act katharine had prepared a little speech that seems to me extremely well written william although of course i dont know enough to criticize in detail but its the skill that strikes younot the emotion in a fragment like that of course the skill strikes one most but perhapshave you time to listen to one more short piece the scene between the lovers theres some real feeling in that i think denham agrees that its the best thing ive done youve read it to ralph,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
747,now ive written this it comes over me that of course all the time katharine has what he hasnt she does command she isnt nervous it comes naturally to her to rule and control its time that she should give all this to some one who will need her when we arent there save in our spirits for whatever people say im sure i shall come back to this wonderful world where ones been so happy and so miserable where even now i seem to see myself stretching out my hands for another present from the great fairy tree whose boughs are still hung with enchanting toys though they are rarer now perhaps and between the branches one sees no longer the blue sky but the stars and the tops of the mountains one doesnt know any more does one one hasnt any advice to give ones children one can only,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
748,black which filled the armchair mrs milvain was a much slighter figure but the same doubt as to the precise lines of her contour filled ralph as he regarded them with dismal foreboding what remark of his would ever reach these fabulous and fantastic charactersfor there was something fantastically unreal in the curious swayings and noddings of mrs cosham as if her equipment included a large wire spring her voice had a highpitched cooing note which prolonged words and cut them short until the english language seemed no longer fit for common purposes in a moment of nervousness so ralph thought katharine had turned on innumerable electric lights but mrs cosham had gained impetus perhaps her swaying movements had that end in view for sustained speech and she now addressed ralph deliberately and elaborately i come from woking mr popham you may well ask me why woking and to that i,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

756,in the world are they after she asked of her own reflection in the little lookingglass which hung there she was not left to doubt much longer for on coming back into the sittingroom with the teathings katharine informed her apparently having been instructed so to do by william of their engagement william she said thinks that perhaps you dont know we are going to be married mary found herself shaking williams hand and addressing her congratulations to him as if katharine were inaccessible she had indeed taken hold of the teakettle let me see katharine said one puts hot water into the cups first doesnt one you have some dodge of your own havent you william about making tea mary was half inclined to suspect that this was said in order to conceal nervousness but if so the concealment was unusually perfect talk of marriage was dismissed katharine might have,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
757,and exactly as the feet of a persian cat stepping among china ornaments for the second time that day mary felt herself baffled by something inscrutable in the character of a person to whom she felt herself much attracted she thought that if she were engaged to katharine she too would find herself very soon using those fretful questions with which william evidently teased his bride and yet katharines voice was humble i wonder how you find the time to know all about pictures as well as books she asked how do i find the time william answered delighted mary guessed at this little compliment why i always travel with a notebook and i ask my way to the picture gallery the very first thing in the morning and then i meet men and talk to them theres a man in my office who knows all about the flemish school i,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

763,it annoyed him that she should have plans of which he knew nothing but he felt that he had no right to press her further his mind settled upon the idea of life in a country cottage conceivably for he could not examine into it now here lay a tremendous possibility a solution of many problems he struck his stick upon the earth and stared through the dusk at the shape of the country dyou know the points of the compass he asked well of course said mary what dyou take me fora cockney like you she then told him exactly where the north lay and where the south its my native land this she said i could smell my way about it blindfold as if to prove this boast she walked a little quicker so that ralph found it difficult to keep pace with her at the same time he,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

768,no doubt its much more amusing to sit up here and talk to henry we were discussing coalmines said henry urbanely yes but we were talking about much more interesting things before that said katharine from the apparent determination to hurt him with which she spoke henry thought that some sort of explosion on rodneys part was about to take place i can quite understand that said rodney with his little chuckle leaning over the back of his chair and tapping the woodwork lightly with his fingers they were all silent and the silence was acutely uncomfortable to henry at least was it very dull william katharine suddenly asked with a complete change of tone and a little gesture of her hand of course it was dull william said sulkily well you stay and talk to henry and ill go down she replied she rose as she spoke and as she,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

771,then she turned her mind to what she had said its the most interesting life she corrected herself she looked at her daughter with a look of vague alarm it was the kind of maternal scrutiny which suggests that in looking at her daughter a mother is really looking at herself she was not altogether satisfied but she purposely made no attempt to break down the reserve which as a matter of fact was a quality she particularly admired and depended upon in her daughter but when her mother said that marriage was the most interesting life katharine felt as she was apt to do suddenly for no definite reason that they understood each other in spite of differing in every possible way yet the wisdom of the old seems to apply more to feelings which we have in common with the rest of the human race than to our feelings,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

773,she retired indoors with a sense that she had played her part and a sigh at the thought that none of her children felt it necessary to play theirs the carriage bowled along smoothly over the gently curving road mrs hilbery dropped into a pleasant inattentive state of mind in which she was conscious of the running green lines of the hedges of the swelling ploughland and of the mild blue sky which served her after the first five minutes for a pastoral background to the drama of human life and then she thought of a cottage garden with the flash of yellow daffodils against blue water and what with the arrangement of these different prospects and the shaping of two or three lovely phrases she did not notice that the young people in the carriage were almost silent henry indeed had been included against his wish and revenged himself by,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

778,is he exclaimed abruptly what are you talking about she replied rather vaguely still looking out of the window he resented this divided attention more than perhaps he knew and he thought how mary would soon be on her way to america mary he said i want to talk to you havent we nearly done why dont they take away these plates mary felt his agitation without looking at him she felt convinced that she knew what it was that he wished to say to her theyll come all in good time she said and felt it necessary to display her extreme calmness by lifting a saltcellar and sweeping up a little heap of breadcrumbs i want to apologize ralph continued not quite knowing what he was about to say but feeling some curious instinct which urged him to commit himself irrevocably and to prevent the moment of intimacy from passing,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
779,seemed to him that something of a terrible and devastating nature had happened the waiter changed their plates once more in his agitation ralph rose turned his back upon mary and looked out of the window the people in the street seemed to him only a dissolving and combining pattern of black particles which for the moment represented very well the involuntary procession of feelings and thoughts which formed and dissolved in rapid succession in his own mind at one moment he exulted in the thought that mary loved him at the next it seemed that he was without feeling for her her love was repulsive to him now he felt urged to marry her at once now to disappear and never see her again in order to control this disorderly race of thought he forced himself to read the name on the chemists shop directly opposite him then to examine,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
780,so many difficult speeches and abortive meetings that she was jerked directly back to the london drawingroom the family relics and the teatable and at the same time recalled some halffinished or interrupted remark which she had wanted to make herself or to hear from himshe could not remember what it was i expect it was me she said i was looking for my mother it happens every time we come to lincoln in fact there never was a family so unable to take care of itself as ours is not that it very much matters because some one always turns up in the nick of time to help us out of our scrapes once i was left in a field with a bull when i was a babybut where did we leave the carriage down that street or the next the next i think she glanced back and saw that,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
781,not a fool after all i cant have been utterly mistaken all these years and yet when she speaks to me like that the truth of it is he thought that ive got such despicable faults that no one could help speaking to me like that katharine is quite right and yet those are not my serious feelings as she knows quite well how can i change myself what would make her care for me he was terribly tempted here to break the silence by asking katharine in what respects he could change himself to suit her but he sought consolation instead by running over the list of his gifts and acquirements his knowledge of greek and latin his knowledge of art and literature his skill in the management of meters and his ancient westcountry blood but the feeling that underlay all these feelings and puzzled him profoundly and kept him,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
782,in a flash the conviction that not to care is the uttermost sin of all stamped itself upon her inmost thought and she felt herself branded for ever he had taken her arm and held her hand firmly in his nor had she the force to resist what now seemed to her his enormously superior strength very well she would submit as her mother and her aunt and most women perhaps had submitted and yet she knew that every second of such submission to his strength was a second of treachery to him i did say i would marry you but it was wrong she forced herself to say and she stiffened her arm as if to annul even the seeming submission of that separate part of her for i dont love you william youve noticed it every ones noticed it why should we go on pretending when i told you,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

785,pliant woman would have taken this chance of an explanation whatever risks attached to it but to one of marys firm and resolute temperament there was degradation in the idea of selfabandonment let the waves of emotion rise ever so high she could not shut her eyes to what she conceived to be the truth her silence puzzled ralph he searched his memory for words or deeds that might have made her think badly of him in his present mood instances came but too quickly and on top of them this culminating proof of his basenessthat he had asked her to marry him when his reasons for such a proposal were selfish and halfhearted you neednt answer he said grimly there are reasons enough i know but must they kill our friendship mary let me keep that at least oh she thought to herself with a sudden rush of anguish which,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
786,the better i shall want your help she promised this and they went on to talk calmly of things that had no reference to their feelingsa talk which in its constraint was infinitely sad to both of them one more reference was made to the state of things between them late that night when elizabeth had gone to her room and the two young men had stumbled off to bed in such a state of sleep that they hardly felt the floor beneath their feet after a days shooting mary drew her chair a little nearer to the fire for the logs were burning low and at this time of night it was hardly worth while to replenish them ralph was reading but she had noticed for some time that his eyes instead of following the print were fixed rather above the page with an intensity of gloom that came to,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
787,full of selfreproach for the suffering he had caused on the contrary he was extremely angry with the confused impotent anger of one who finds himself unreasonably but efficiently frustrated he was trapped by the illogicality of human life the obstacles in the way of his desire seemed to him purely artificial and yet he could see no way of removing them marys words the tone of her voice even angered him for she would not help him she was part of the insanely jumbled muddle of a world which impedes the sensible life he would have liked to slam the door or break the hind legs of a chair for the obstacles had taken some such curiously substantial shape in his mind i doubt that one human being ever understands another he said stopping in his march and confronting mary at a distance of a few feet such damned liars,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism
788,judge people by what they do you cant go through life measuring right and wrong with a footrule thats what youre always doing mary thats what youre doing now she saw herself in the suffrage office delivering judgment meting out right and wrong and there seemed to her to be some justice in the charge although it did not affect her main position im not angry with you she said slowly i will go on seeing you as i said i would it was true that she had promised that much already and it was difficult for him to say what more it was that he wantedsome intimacy some help against the ghost of katharine perhaps something that he knew he had no right to ask and yet as he sank into his chair and looked once more at the dying fire it seemed to him that he had been defeated,VirginiaWoolf,female,early_modernism

1180,day restored me to some degree of tranquillity and when i considered what had passed at the cottage i could not help believing that i had been too hasty in my conclusions i had certainly acted imprudently it was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf and i was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children i ought to have familiarised the old de lacey to me and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family when they should have been prepared for my approach but i did not believe my errors to be irretrievable and after much consideration i resolved to return to the cottage seek the old man and by my representations win him to my party these thoughts calmed me and in the afternoon i sank into a profound sleep but the fever of,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic
1181,and finding that it was already night i crept forth from my hidingplace and went in search of food when my hunger was appeased i directed my steps towards the wellknown path that conducted to the cottage all there was at peace i crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose that hour passed the sun mounted high in the heavens but the cottagers did not appear i trembled violently apprehending some dreadful misfortune the inside of the cottage was dark and i heard no motion i cannot describe the agony of this suspense presently two countrymen passed by but pausing near the cottage they entered into conversation using violent gesticulations but i did not understand what they said as they spoke the language of the country which differed from that of my protectors soon after however felix approached with another man,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic

1183,horizon the edge of which the moon nearly touched a part of its orb was at length hid and i waved my brand it sank and with a loud scream i fired the straw and heath and bushes which i had collected the wind fanned the fire and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues as soon as i was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation i quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods and now with the world before me whither should i bend my steps i resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes but to me hated and despised every country must be equally horrible at length the thought of you crossed my mind i learned from your papers that you were my father,MaryShelley,female,gothic/romantic

1262,is capable of measuring distances and drawing conclusions with all the accuracy needful to its welfare and the fact that mr rosedales drawingroom manner lacked perspective made lily class him with trenor and the other dull men she knew and assume that a little flattery and the occasional acceptance of his hospitality would suffice to render him innocuous however there could be no doubt of the expediency of showing herself in his box on the opening night of the opera and after all since judy trenor had promised to take him up that winter it was as well to reap the advantage of being first in the field for a day or two after rosedales visit lilys thoughts were dogged by the consciousness of trenors shadowy claim and she wished she had a clearer notion of the exact nature of the transaction which seemed to have put her in his power,EdithWharton,female,naturalism
